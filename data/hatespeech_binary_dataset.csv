13	Peter Hallam, Islam is not a race. I don't care about peoples sexuality, nationality or race, but religion is a choice. Being a moderate Muslim is like being a moderate nazi or moderate kkk member.

24	Delfina Jones 1. Islam is the MAIN reason why science is in europe in the first place exists. Most of the scientific books from the past were somehow related to Europe and Asia and then the Roman empire got destroyed, Greek texts were lost (Guess who? religion abused through corrupt christians priests). and what did islam do? simple: It was narrated that Anas bin Mâlik said: The Messenger of Allah said “Seeking knowledge is a duty upon every Muslim”. AND: It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said: “The Messenger of Allah said: “…Whoever follows a path in pursuit of knowledge, Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise... This resulted in muslims translating the books they could find about any knowledge to be translated. They see it as a way to enter paradise and to teach the future generations would increase your likelyhood. Europe was pretty much crumbling until the renaissance came and where did they go to read about how to retrieve the knowledge of the greek and roman texts? well, from Istanbul of course, the city that belongs to the muslims. I recommend you watching Crash course if you'd like.	0	test
25	It's sad that those people shown in the video hold such extreme beliefs. They were too sheltered and they have a false belief that their views are the only views. How they acted was inappropriate. That being said, there is another side to this religion. I have seen that side as well. To ignore that side is ignorance itself. It's where Islam converges with Western beliefs. The result from that is actually very calm. Anyone who is like those in the video are in the wrong, I agree. We don't need those people. It causes chaos. But anyone who only focuses on that side is just as wrong. Muslim values can be compatible with Western values. You just have never seen it, or perhaps don't want to, but I have.	0	test
26	"Delfina Jones 2. Though islam is a religion that shows similar patterns to judaism and Christianity, the religion was giving in clear message that 1. it came in peace:The worshippers of the All-Merciful are they who tread gently upon the earth, and when the ignorant address them, they reply, “Peace!” ""Quran: 25:63 and: And when they hear vain talk, they turn away from it and say: “To us our deeds, and to you yours; peace be to you: we do not seek out the ignorant. Quran: 28:55 (the first letters to ever come from quran, sent to humanity was ""READ!"" = KNOWLEDGE) 2. it was finalizing what came from the previous religions but also adding alot of details that will make it almost IMPOSSIBLE to be corrupted (memorizing by all muslims, scientific facts, stories from the past, more laws and the way it's written is just not HUMAN. It's so precise)."	0	test
27	Commenting back on how you said being a moderate Muslim is like being a moderate KKK or Nazi; if that's true then all religions apply. All major religions have a negative side. To be a true believer, you have to belive in that negative side. Well.. Come to think of it.. Humanity is evil within itself. I guess we have an agreeing point.	0	test

31	Delfina Jones 3. It gave blacks and women rights = It can't get any WESTERN than this. At a time when women were treated worse than animals and slaves were beaten for just a TINY mistake, the prophet shed some light to these people. let me ask you something: If you are to be the in one of the RICHEST tribes in the land but your family believes in something that you just don't feel is you. You have a different opinion and tell those who suffer from YOUR family that there is something better that will make them more valuable but that they need to sacrifice their belongings to a more simple life , what are the odds that those who believe would be sick, poor, old, slaves and women? Those who have nothing, those who have no value in society, finally they are something to someone: God. think about that also: read this: http://www.soundvision.com/article/islams-manifesto-of-universal-brotherhood-of-human-beings	0	test
32	"Delfina Jones If you're gonna use the ""what about those who bomb people and scream in your religions name"". I say this: Christians who live in peace are CLOSER to the title of ""muslim"" than these bombers can ever be. You wanna know why they're strapping a bomb around their waist? It's because there are western governments that have bombed their houses, broken families (members dying) and knowledge being wasted (because they spend more time fighting you than reading a book). In the past, the prophet and his friends fought because they defended. There are people out there, who proudly stand as muslims and protect their country from being destroyed from terrorists (The west AND the bombers). Why should they be marked as stupid or ignorant or a terrorist? I live in a country where there's a party that's the second largest. They speak ill about anyone. immigrants, women, religious, those who rebel. They stand proudly for what they speak yet say that they know how to save our country (kinda like D.T) but they don't. They wear fancy suits and speak in a lovely manner but their purpose is loud and clear everytime and yet people still believe that they are right. Islam was beautiful. it shed light to those who were oppressed, abused, hated. Now there are those who abuse its name just to get what they want. Giving it a bad name when they don't even know what it's been through. SO JUST STOP. Muslims don't make Islam better. Islam makes muslims better. I rest my case..."	0	test
33	Islam gave women rights just like Saudi Arabia allowed them to vote to give them the illusion of rights too. Women in Muslim countries have no rights like women do in the west. I wonder how your parents and brothers would have reacted if you decided to announce to them you were becoming an atheist, putting a mini skirt on and going to spend a weekend at your boyfriend's house. I have read Quran and its misogyny is transparent. Also women rights are non existent in Muslim countries because they have religious laws, not secular laws. There is a lot of ex Muslim women who were raised in Islam and say the same thing. Also, you have completely ignored my question again.	1	test
34	Delfina Jones I like how you say that EVERY MUSLIM COUNTRY represents islam. for gods sake, they have different cultures you know. THEY are the reason why these countries are a mess. Afghanistan is not Saudi Arabia. Pakistan is not Egypt. Somalia is not Turkey. There is a difference but they share islam as a faith. Still, they have caused many violations that have clearly been condemned by the religion but NO ONE seems to care if someone opens it and shoves it towards media and those who did the act. oh wait...don't muslims from all over the world do that?	0	test
35	It is compatible with Western beliefs. I am proof of that. My parents are both Muslim and I was born and raised in the USA. I was taught to read the Quran and to be a good person. My dad wasn't too pleased with Quran school and he had a good reason. He didn't want me brainwashed into extreme Islam. I see why, those people are horrible and their ideals are best left for the stone age. My dad believed in the freedom of every being. My dad never told my mom what to do. My mom doesn't cover and she works full time, not a house wife. I was taught to be independent, taught how to drive by my dad, was encouraged to work and to make my own decisions. I respect other people's beliefs and sexualities. My friends consist of many different backgrounds and beliefs. I'm friends with an atheist, bisexual, gay, lesbian, and transgender. I even enjoy conversations with this very religious Christian. To me they aren't those labels, they are just people whom I enjoy being with. My sister goes to a Christian University and has made friends with a nun. Everyone should have the right to belive what they want and no one should force any believe on them. So tell me, am I not western enough? You can't look at life through horse blinders. There are bad and good people everywhere. To belive elsewise makes you just as bad as those extremist because they too are looking at life through horse blinders.	0	test
36	Yet each one of these countries implements religious laws, each is a backward hole where women are treated like cattle, Turkey is the most normal one because funnily enough is also the least religious. The only times when Islamic countries were advancing was when religion was pushed aside, such as during Sha in Iran.	1	test

42	@ Delfina Jones, three things: 1. Extreme Ethnocentrism to the point of disregarding others' opinions and putting yours at highest 2. Insulting people's opinions to raise your own to prove you're right 3. The Islam faith is one like Christianity where Christianity dominates a lot of Europe and the western Countries in which Christianity went through destruction and death to get where it is today (referencing back to religious laws back then in European history, the Crusades, colonization and teaching the beliefs of Christianity using it for manipulation, etc). The Islamic religion is going through a similar scenario of extremists like Christianity did as well as probably all religions (over generalizing but you get the point, hopefully). Many are dying yes, and modernization has let those extremists cause a lot more damage globally however, what must be kept in mind is that there are some who do need help. Ignoring a problem won't make it go away. Yes, countries like yours have internal issues to solve but without the world, globalization from countries other than yours, the country you currently live in wouldn't have developed into the way it is today. Which is most likely pretty modernized. Congratulations, you won the lottery ticket of privilege. Unfortunately others didn't. And you most likely won, as well as many of us, from immigration from the origin of our countries. The reason of immigration may be different for all of us but it's certain that we moved for the reason of a better life. If your family was denied to immigrate, you could've been in the Syrian's shoes or your descendants would have faced more issues while your origin county developed possibly ending your family line, meaning you wouldn't have been born. Try stepping into others' shoes and keep an open mind. Thank you	0	test

Everyone's welcome in my country as long as they are willing to assimilate with regards to local values and culture which majority of Muslim immigrants have failed. And your argument where you have brought up the crusades is pathetic, the best you can do is bring up 12th century events? Do you know which century we currently have? If Islam is going through violent stages then I'd like for it to be going through it in Middle East and Africa, not in Europe where all I care about is the safety of my family and friends.	1	test

52	David Olend For the west to be longsighted and not support extremists groups at the sake of making money or short term goals. ISIS would not be anywhere as powerful as it is today if western powers didn't illegally occupy iraq and completely remove all army personnel and councillors. Borders were left open and many ex-soldiers started working with al qaeda to fight the occupation. Al qaeda was non existant during Saddam's time. It simply wasn't there. ISIS is an offshoot of al qaeda. The west supported and financed al qaeda against the Russians in Afghanistan. Also the west's attempt of removing bashar by supplying weapons to the ''moderate rebels'' in Syria was just stupid. A lot of these weapons ended up with ISIS making them stronger. We all know that the west supports Saudi Arabia, a big funder of extremists organisations. Saudi Arabia is the UK's biggest purchaser of weapons. The less powerful ISIS and Al Qaeda are the less propaganda there is to brainwash people with. There are many factors leading to the mess we are in and the west's middle east policy is one factor.	1	test
53	David, I wish I knew. If I had that knowledge I would definitely share it. They are sheltered and misguided, their women uneducated, their men brought up with ideas that they are superior. How does one deal with any brainwashed group? Way before this issue came to Europe, I grew up seeing it in Turkey. Yes, Turkey is not run by Sharia law but there are still extreme individuals who take it into their own hands. The only thing I've seen work, and very slowly, is just to start educating those children. Have the next generation more knowledgeable about the world.	1	test
54	Seriously? So your suggestion is to somehow smuggle western learning material to the children of these groups. Wow. Okay, let me ask you this, do you believe that sovereign nations have a right to protect their borders and their citizens against those who pose a threat to them?	0	test
55	Hadi Jawad You are absolutely correct in your analysis of who is responsible for the creation of ISIS. But that wasn't the topic of discussion between Esin Ayse Kaya and myself. There is an immediate threat spreading through Europe at the moment. One that needs to be immediately eliminated.	1	test
56	David Olend I think what Esin meant was that eduction is the key to fighting religious extremism and it's true. That's why Europe needs to stop allowing for so much religious freedom including religious schools etc. Schools need to be secular ,no headscarves in schools, teach Muslim kids since they are little that it's ok to be gay, that women are equal to men etc. This is by the way the least we can do on top of stopping immigration from Muslim countries. I am pro EU but I'd advocate for abolishing of the schengen zone after what Merkel has done.	1	test
57	David, your response has left me bewildered due to the tone of immaturity and I believe you don't understand what I'm talking about. I meant the task of going to school. Education does change ideals, and like I said, it's what I have seen work. Like I also said, I don't have a solution. I'm just sharing what I've seen. My mom started out in a very religious, though not extreme, home. She was the first girl to go to school in her family. After going to school, her view became more modern. She broke off from the idea that women are only supposed to be serving men. I'm sorry if that's not the response you wanted. The current situation is a delicate one. Handle it the wrong way and you end up creating more extremists instead of diminishing their numbers. To answer your next question: I do believe all nations have a right to protect their citizens from any sort of threat. But how to deal with that threat is another issue. All in all.. Just because I am Muslim doesn't mean I am equiped to provide solutions for this situation or any similar situation . I can only tell you my experience. I can only say I don't want to see anyone get hurt. It's ignorant of me to say that but that's just how I feel.	0	test
58	Delfina Jones 1. you just told me that I was sarcastic behind the screen but clearly I wasn't. Do you even know what it even means? . 2. You're telling me that I did not name ONE positive thing that Islam gave to the west. Are you blind? I gave you a very clear point and i STRENGTHEND it with sources. They are NOT opinions. They are clear and strong FACTS. unlike what you babble about 3. You're just repeating the exact same thing: Calling me stupid, making insults about my religion and then telling me that I'm wrong because...your opinion? So to conclude: You are the reason why I wanna bash my head on a wall and forget that I ever read your comments. and please, oh wise one, I challenge you. Name ONE thing that makes islam bad.	1	test
59	David Olend I don't think the threat to Europe is going to be from refugees coming in from Iraq or Syria. If ISIS manages to blow something up in the UK it will be a British or another EU national who will be carrying out these activities. I would assume that any refugee coming in the country would have some tight surveillance on them. What ISIS wants is division because that works in their favour. The more division the easier it is to convince people that there is a big difference between us and them. The more hate crime the more the propaganda will work. So what we can do is show how ridicilous ISIS and other radical groups are. A school program will have to be included in school to teach muslims and non-muslims how groups like ISIS are at crossroads with Islamic teachings. The majority of people killed by ISIS are muslim and they are burning muslim town after town in Syria. Also programs outside school are needed to educate muslims and non-muslims about Islam and to clarify certain scriptures that are causing confusing. Such programs have already started but of course we need to see more. Muslims have been a lot more active in explaining to others about Islam after recent events. So yes education is key.	0	test
60	Sagal Aden I have never called you stupid, but you very conveniently haven't addressed the points I have made. I have already pointed out many things that are bad about Islam: you almost worship a man who was a rapist and a pedophile, your book says that women can be raped if taken into slavery, your book allows a man to take 4 wives yet a woman isn't allowed 4 husbands, is she. Your religion requires total submission, shames women, doesn't allow them to make free choices. You haven't given me any positives about Islam, you have referred to very far past, again what has Islam brought to the west in last 30 years apart from misery, honour killings, bombings, rapes etc. Even Salman Rashdie had fatwa issued against him because he criticized Islam. I'm sorry but your religion doesn't merit respect because it's a religion. It's a choice and represents certain views and ideology and it will be subjected to judgment.	1	test
61	"to not respect a religion it is not the same thing to not respect the people !!!And this is what so many Muslims of our days don t want to understand (and imedialtely call the others ""racists ) !

64	Just to clarify I am not muslim so this is not MY religion. I have had the chance to live in Iraq (half my life), UAE and the UK so I have tiptoed into both worlds ‘us vs them’. Delina: i think the most important thing you have to question is whether muslims believe that these things you mentioned apply today or whether they apply at all. 1. The whole muhammad marrying Aysha at the age of 9 is debated heavily within the muslim community itself. Some say she wasn’t 9. Even if she was we need to remember that we are talking about 1,400 years ago where there are numerous cases of such things happening within that region. Most importantly, do muslims marry 9 year olds. Rarely. I’ve only heard of cases in Egypt and Saudi. So muslims do not agree with this and it rarely occurs. 2. Nearly all muslims believe that the whole slavery thing is misinterpreted. People interpret it as during war when you come across women do not make them the untouchables and that you should marry them if you want (marriage in the quran requires both consents) and treat them equally. With regards to other slaves, muslims believe that their prophet brought a lot of new rights to salves, changing the roman slavery rules. In addition, a lot of slaves were freed. A lot of the things I have read confirm this. 3. The whole marrying 4 i think was there to spread Islam. I have never come across anyone in my life that has married more than 1 and tbh it only happens in some societies like Saudia Arabia. Nearly all muslims marry 1 person. So again applicable then and not now. 4.Women rights. The whole covering your self completely is simply incorrect. Quran requires you to be modest and not for full out covering. It’s more of a culture thing (or should i say a tribal thing) plus people used to wear it for protection from the sand. I am not joking when I say this but during my 13 years in Baghdad i saw less burkas than in my 3 years in London. In the society I lived in, all my friends' muslim moms went to uni, had jobs and lived equally to men. Within the same families you can find women covering their hair and some that don't. Different interpretation of modesty. This is in Iraq, UAE and the UK. Saudi Arabia is not how the majority of muslim women live and really does not represent Islam. FGM for example again only happens in some societies and not across the muslim world. In fact its mostly an african thing and happens a lot in non-muslim countries. 5. Your statement that muslims have only brought misery to the west is a bit extreme. you have put Sunnis, Shias, Alawites, Whabasim, Ahmadeyia, Druze and many others all in one group. Muslim immigration has worked wonderfully in some situations and haven’t worked in other situations. This depends on a lot of factors such as the people coming to the west, the people receiving the immigrants, the programs in place to connect both. For examples, there are so so many muslims in the NHS. If we are going through the route of blaming the whole group then the middle east can say the same about the west. The west has only brought misery to the middle east, from the Sykes-Picot agreement, to the overthrow of the Iranian government in 1953, to supporting Saddam, supporting Al qaeda against the russions, illegally occupying Iraq, supplying weapons to the Syrian rebels, giving weapons to Qaddafi and then taking him out and supporting countries with extreme ideologies. How many dictators have the west supported? Should we block all the west from entering the middle east. Should we build walls around every country in the world. So the misconception people have with Islam is to do with the Quran. Do muslims apply certain verses to their everyday life or do they think that some verses only apply to the past with some parts being story telling. The quran is in arabic, written 1,400 years ago, so are we interpreting the quran correctly? I am sure how things were said 1400 years ago is different to how we speak now. In my experience, most of the muslims i know, and I know a lot given that i used to live in Iraq and the UAE, agree that some versers are not applicable today or they interpret those verses differently. David I couldn’t watch your video for some reason.	0	test

66	"Delfina Jones 1. I don't worship a pedophile. I respect and adore a prophet. Placing him into the category of a pedophile is beyond pathetic as he lived 1400 YEARS. 1400 years. People change in 1400 years. In the future, people would call us pedophiles for marrying people at the age of 20-28. That's the problem that you don't seem to understand. It was a norm to marry women at a young age. How can I call someone who lived more than a thousand years ago a rapist if it was a normal thing for EVERY human on the planet at that point to marry young females? Marriage is also a choice in islam. I'm a young woman yet my parents don't force me to marry at a young age. THAT is culture. A culture that has ruined the true image of islam by mixing its own blend to make islam look ""nice"" for them. But it isn't. 2. Slavery is allowed but we rather call it housekeeping as slavery basically means a slave being owned to a master and does everything that the master tells him to do. Islam is against that as it says that all ""slaves"" should wear the same clothes as the master, eat at the dinnertable with its master and to not be forced to do work that is beyond their strength...kind of sounds like a familymember to me. You're not allowed to rape anyone because that is considered Zina: an act that is forbidden by Allah. And the whole marriage by 4 women but women can only marry 1 man: I don't remember exactly but it was something to do with there being more women than men in our world (because war). However, that doesn't mean that a man can just randomly go get a second wife just like that. He has to ask his first wife and if she agrees (nowadays a i doubt that), he has to go through his finances so he knows that he's able to take care of a second. I doubt even more that there will be a woman that would want to share their love for a husband with another which makes it harder for a man to find a second wife. If men aren't capable of taking care of one wife (as it says in the quran but you don't seem to care about that), the man MUST settle with having one. Also, nowehere in the quran does it state how many husbands a woman can have but yes it does say a man can have 4 wives. For women, it would mean that she could marry as many as she pleases (though WHY would a woman wanna do that? I don't wanna have more than one husband and I know for certain that we would enjoy putting our efforts and love for one guy and not many and men would not enjoy having to share their love for one woman but some regions in the world have different norms (which i'm TRYING TO POINT OUT because the prophet and those who lived with him existed in a different time with DIFFERENT norms). Today we have somewhat the same norms but because of differences in timeline, we change alot for the better but know that we can follow the same norms. It's just that it's very important to make everyone and God happy . 2. Slavery is allowed but we rather call it housekeeping as slavery basically means a slave being owned to a master and does everything that the master tells him to do. Islam is against that as it says that all ""slaves"" should wear the same clothes as the master, eat at the dinnertable with its master and to not be forced to do work that is beyond their strength...kind of sounds like a familymember to me.

If men aren't capable of taking care of one wife (as it says in the quran but you don't seem to care about that), the man MUST settle with having one. 3. You want to know the positives that Islam has brought 30 YEARS FROM NOW? You weren't being clear with your point as you challenged me to state the positive things that Islam has brought to the west. I did but you are so reluctant to holding on to your opinion because 30 years ago, many ARABIC countries, not islamic, ARABIC countries decided to rebel against their leaders, resulting in new leaders and more rebellious groups are formed to overthrow the leaders. They use anything that is necessary to take down the leader and when they do, they have NO IDEA on how to govern at all. Are these muslims? Of course not. If strongly hold on to your actions and blame people when clearly there were better options (peace deals), then you're not a muslim. You're an idiot. Ignorant idiots. 4. The BIGGEST issue that I have with people criticizing isla m is that they point out issues with countries and how they govern. Both sides (the west AND ""muslim"" countries) are doing everything they can, knowingly and unknowingly sabbotaging the religion that once stated that through knowledge and peace, there will be victory. The problem isn't interely muslim countries, it's nationalism. It still exists and is the main reason why many have such hatred and rage towards others. even countries considered ""muslim"" have a grudge against each other (look at Saudi Arabia and Iran). Islam is a religion that unifies people, wether colour, race, sex, age or ethnicity. All it takes is an open mind and you might learn things beyond the screams and echoes from the media. I have watched Christianity and its history, I have seen the issues with Zionism vs Judaism, I have heard of people who believe in Buddhism but do terrible acts against others. WE humans are responsible for OUR actions and what we bring forth to our religion. Islam is always waiting for people to listen to it but many have always glared behind for other things and sometimes turned their cheeks. I CAN BRING a good image of Islam and I can also BRING a bad image of it aswell but Islam as a whole is never changed. It stays the same. Only I can become distorted or bad. THAT is why you see muslims bombing themselves and killing in the name of God: They are enraged, confused and don't know about Islam. When you live in a place where foreigners (US) have bombed, destroyed unity, taken their properties and placed terrible leaders there, what are the odds that you end up becoming confused of the situation, just like many, and do everything necessary to take back the good times. Suddenly you get it back but what CAN you do? You don't know how to govern, you know how to fight. All rebellious groups start out well, fighting for justice and then suddenly along the way, they become confused and even mad with power and strength that God has given them, only to use it to hurt others and blame God for that. There is a problem in these places but to solve it, PEOPLE NEED TO STOP BALING EVERYTHING ON ISLAM AND GET THEIR BUTTS OFF OF THESE PLACES and I'm talking mainly about the US. PS: My religion is MY choice but just like you have your choice, I wish to respect it and the same should go with you."	1	test
67	Are you human, Delfina Jones? When your ancestral lot thrashed themselves at the mercy of other foreign lands, others gave welcome to them. How can you be such a sociopath to feel comfortable enough to suggest that people in need be shut out? You are sick. Can we just shut up about you, Delfina? Can you just return to your residence and get out of your holiday picture area? Perhaps you should be excluded from travel to other holiday destinations?	1	test
68	"Because most of them aren't in need you naive fool. Bbc is showing you these heartbreaking images of refugees while in reality most of them settled in Libanon and Jordan and the rest is dying. Those that come to Europe are greedy violent opportunists and economic migrant. But like a naive fool that you obviously are you believe in everything that leftist media shows you, Robert Hidalgo. And that ""holiday destination"" is in my own country, moron."	1	test
69	Delfina Most of them settled in Lebanon? You make it sound so nice. 70% of the 1m Syrian refugees in Lebanon live below the poverty line. Jordan and Lebanon are tiny tiny countries. http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=52893#.Vnue_UK0m20 This is not how you describe settled darling. 36% of those entering Europe are children and women. But in your eyes even muslim children are violent. We all know that there are more men entering because the route to europe is risky with lots of people dying. But not to worry, in the UK the figures will be much better as they will be taking families from the camps themselves so the minority will be men.	0	test
70	Hadi Jawad I am familiar with UN statistics. I was talking about make immigrants from countries other than Syria who traveled to Europe. Even Syrian refugees however broke the law when they refused to register in Hungary and demanded to go to Germany and Sweden, countries with the highest welfare. If you're escaping from a war torn country to be safe, then you're safe but you're very poor so you go to another country which is also not good enough so you travel through 9 more to get to the best one then you're not a refugee. Also that 64% of men are cowards, west should arm them and send them to fight isis just like our grandparents fought the nazis.	1	test
71	Delfina you mentioned Lebanon and Jordan. Most of the refugees that have gone there in the past year will be Syrian. 70% live below the poverty line. Also you point of refugees going to the other countries in Europe is not valid. Germany said that it will accept 800k. So why wouldn't you go to such a country who has the infrastructure to take you in and make use of your skills. Why would anyone stay in Hungary? have you seen how they have treated the refugees? Like animals. A couple of questions regarding Syrians being cowards that I hope you can answer: 1. Who are the Syrian people supposed to push out? Bashar/government? Al Qaeda? ISIS? or the hundred other rebel factions fighting? 2. Where are you supposed to get the money to buy the weapons? Did your grandparents find the weapons under their house or were they supplied by your government? 3. Would you keep your family under ISIS control while you are fighting? Would you take the risk that your child may be taken away at any moment or that an airstrike will come and kill the whole family? 4. Are all refugees leaving war cowards? Are Jews cowards for leaving Germany? 5. ISIS knocks on your door and tells you come with us now you need to fight or we kill your family. What do you do? This also means killing civilians. 6. The government knocks on your door and tells you come with us now you need to fight or we kill your family. What do you do? This also means killing civilians. You clearly have a problem with all muslims, be them children, women or trees because to you there is one type of muslim. They are all the same.	0	test

80	"Leah Jo, Wars In the Middle East Have Created More Terrorists!! Security experts including both conservatives and liberals in America agree that waging war in the Middle East weakens International security and increases terrorism. Killing innocent civilians is one of the main things which increases terrorism. Starting wars against states which do not pose an imminent threat to International security increases the threat of terrorism because: One of the principal causes of terrorism is injuries to people and families. The Iraq war wasn’t even fought to combat terrorism. And Al Qaeda wasn’t even in Iraq until the U.S. invaded that country. So the widespread program of war on terror and torture under the Bush administration didn’t help. If we want a better world than there shouldn't be selective humanity and sympathy, Emphasis should be on as you stated ""NO HUMAN SHOULD SUFFER""."	0	test

103	Russia’s increased activity along the Syrian-Turkish border signifies the closing phases of the Syrian conflict. With Syrian and Kurdish forces holding the border east of the Euphrates, the Afrin-Jarabulus corridor is the only remaining conduit for supplies bound for terrorists in Syria to pass…..When this corridor is closed and supplies cut off, ISIS, Nusra, and all associated NATO-backed factions will atrophy and die as the Syrian military restores order across the country… With that support being cut off and the prospect of these militants being eradicated, the true sponsors behind this conflict are moving more directly and overtly to salvage their failed conspiracy against the Syrian state. What we see emerging is what was suspected and even obvious all along – a proxy war started by, and fought for Western hegemonic ambitions in the region, intentionally feeding the forces of extremism, not fighting them http://off-guardian.org/2015/12/19/why-the-west-can-never-defeat-or-forgive-russia/	1	test

206	BBC just stop lying in general about these countries and the crisis! I'm getting really fed up with this one-sided disgusting propaganda! I know it's not strictly a response to this video, but please let me say this. These people (I'm perfectly aware that not all of them, but most) are very agressive, when they don't get what they want. They demonstrated it very well at the Hungarian-Serbian border two days ago. BBC always shows crying children. But the fact is they're crying, because they are used in order to get sympathy and when they get tossed around they just get scared of the yelling and agression. They're crying because the migrants' actions make them cry. Not the Hungarians, Croatians or Serbians, The migrants always use babies or little children as shields. How can they do this to those poor kids? And they're called 'refugees' by BBC...yeah some refugees these are.... There are leaders among them who tell the crowd what to do via megaphones. Yeah obviously when you're fleeing from danger you must carry megaphones with you in your backpacks...yeah right. And the fact that BBC is assisting this Trojan horse move is outrageous!	1	test
207	How do you know that all of them do that? I am aware that the treatment of children in the middle east is worse than in Western and Central Europe, but surely it is the countries barring them from reaching Germany and Austria, where they can live a much better life and not need to cry at all, as well.	0	test

213	The migrants always use babies or little children as shields - should I believe to your version? The behaviour of Hungary is disgraceful. In italy we had migrants for so many years. Every week they come by boats, we shelter them and don't make walls.Many of them die in the water, ordinary people run in the water to save them. We have lot of controversies in ur nation cos many people don't want them to come, but while they land , and are in need, there is nothing else to do then shelter them with humanity, and this is what people in Lampedusa do. Hungarians know it very well as they were migrants htemselves during the period of their need back in the revolution in the 50s. Over 200,000 of them escaped looking for shelter in the western countries and now that few thousands are in need, they build a wall. Look at ho the hungarians were sheltered at that time. Short of memory? http://67.69.104.76:84/pinetreeline/metz/otherm2/otherm2-16b.html	0	test
214	Janine Ewen First of all, don't you dare yell at me, lady! Second, I refuse to be called narrow-minded! I've never been and I'll never will be. I do understand both sides. However, agression is NEVER acceptable!!! I'm sorry that this is acceptable to you. When they'll end up in the UK, you'll see it with your own eyes! Stop making excuses for them, when you live thousands of kilometers away and you're completely clueless! WE ARE HUMAN TOO and we have rights too. Our country turned into a dump, because of all the rubbish they leave behind and they are agressive. Listen to me, very carefully Janine, we will not tolerate this behavior. This is a civilized, European country, not the Middle East. These savages threw blocks of concrete rocks at our police and 20 of them got injured and they treat their children like dirt. Shame on them and shame on you for being a narrow-minded, uneducated person!	1	test
215	Simone Tocco I understand your point of view. However, excuse me for saying this, but you don't have to deal with nearly as much influx as we do. You get about 400 people a day, we get 3000-8000 a day. There's a bit of a difference there. Yes, it's great that you shelter them, we did too, but they revolted and refused to register according to EU law. And again, excuse me for pointing this out, but what you do doesn't really help the EU. You don't stop them, you just let them through and all of them will flood the UK eventually. Let's be realistic here, most of them are not refugees, they're just looking for a better life. It's great, but Europe's benefits system will collapse under the pressure if we let millions in. There's a much better life in America for example, still i'm not gonna go there, be agressive and demand my rights, while I don't fulfill my obligations.	1	test
216	Agnes Toma, people never like hearing the truth. here is the US it was similar with the South American refugees that where coming (and still are) in scores and the media kept showing children, but not the parents who were abandoning them, throwning these children over the fenses (literally) to forcibly gain entrance into the country. So 7k are placed in my city and state & the crime is immeasurable. Child killings, torture & abductions are higher than ever. Heroin & needle deali dealing is everywhere. Muggings, home invasions and school violence is uncontrollable and domestic violence, well its all day everyday. All this started within a month after the placement of the refugees into the US and 18 months after their placement is way at all just really started to tear down and it's just become a war zone in the state of Massachusetts. The people don't want to believe that these things happen and that people who illegally push their way in or force their way into a country are somehow good and decent and loving and caring and want to make a better life for themselves.

223	George Thornton barring them from entering Germany and Austria??? I'm sorry but you are totally mislead by UK media. Germany and Austria / the EU still insist on Hungary and Slovenia keeping the Schengen border and they introduced border control as well. When Hungary let the migrants pass to Austria it was because Germany offered to let them all in temporarily. They can still push them all back to the country they register, by law. Based on the fact that less than half are actually refugees it would mean 100-150 thousand this year for Hungary alone. If we do not register them, EU can say the Schengen border is in Austria and they re-introduce strict control, leaving Hungary to accommodate them while they wait. There is no good way out of this for us but at least some factual reporting would do in the meantime.	0	test

But the migrants try to get to Austria. Austria is safe. But migrants try to get to Germany. Germany is safe. But migrants try to get to Sweden. These people are NOT refugees. Refugees are people who get to a safe country and ASK for help; which the country then either supplies if it can, or ASKS other countries to supply if it cannot (which is where we come in). People who arrive in a safe country and decide its not quite what they are after, and so march through safe countries to find one they do want, are NOT refugees. They are economic migrants.	1	test

242	I am afraid it is not BBC only.... most western media is doing exactly the same. Huffington post, Sky news and the list goes on. One sided, misleading information was everywhere for an entire week Hungary was on the front page of all the UK newspapers but other issues like arson attacks on refugee camps in Germany, people sleeping on the street in Austria, ( just a side note both of these countries had more time to prepare for the influx of migrants....) violent behaviour towards police were not reported.Mass manipulation at its best..... But looking at the comments I am glad to see that most people cannot be mislead and started to realise how the media is trying to influence them. Also well done for explaining what is happening in Hungary, without going down to a certain level. As I said in my other comments it will be interesting to see how those who refuse to register will be integrated when they cannot respect the first law about border control.....	1	test
243	I was wondering if this biased reporting may actually be arranged by the governments. Perhaps they want to be seen as compliant and humanitarian but actually fear a Muslim spread in Europe. Maybe they are afraid that if they don't help, Muslim countries will attack Europe. Or maybe they know we'll retaliate and argue that they are doing the wrong thing and that lawless people are not welcome so they will have democratic votes against what the UN is proposing. Just can't stand to think they could really be this stupid!	1	test

248	Simone Tocco You have compared the Hungarian refugees from 1956 to the Syrian refugees. You have called our attention to brush up our memory, now I'd like to ask You to do the same. ;-) In 1956 the Hungarians immediately after crossing the border e.g. to Austria they went to the local authorities and co-operated with them. The Hungarians stayed in the refugee-camp as long as they were ordered to do so and left the camps only when they were allowed to. The Hungarians have used their passports to identify themselves and have accepted the registration process. The Hungarians have left the refugee-camps only to that country which accepted them upon their registration data. The Hungarians did not attack the border/fence/soldiers/policemen etc of other countries but they did everything to follow the rules and traditions of the given foreign country. And at last there were only 200.000 Hungarians, while there are 4.000.000 Syrian refugees. The Syrian refugees do not stay in their neighbour countries but they move toward to other countries upon their guess and without any documents. They cross green borders without permit and they do not want to use the OPEN border stations, although those are OPEN. They do not want themselves to be registrated and do not want to stay in the refugee-camps. Instead of co-operating with the local authorities, they attack the borders and the policemen. They do not stay in refugee-camps and do not accept any help (food, drink etc) from the local authorities and churches but money. They do not use even the provided waste bins, but they simply throw their litter to everywhere. They do not want to follow the local law and traditions but show aggressive behaviour. I accept that their norms are different to ours, and that there is a big cultural difference. But it seems to me that at the present only we (Europeans) act tolerantly while they stick to their rigid customs. It is hard to imagine any real co-operation with them if they do not change their attitude.	1	test

And if they were responsible they'd be reaping the benefits right now. They're fleeing poverty, war and dictatorial government, they're not a threat to us, all they bring is competition, which spurs the economy, innovation and a population boost, as long as the EU splits the load evenly these migrants/refugees will be a net gain for Europe, the way it's currently being managed though is that Germany will be overrun, fuelling tensions, spreading fear and causing problems, the burden needs to be shared for this to work.	1	test

270	Yes, if you think in racial terms, the term 'we' to me means Britons, individuals born in Britain, which include a wide variety of ethnicities, who receive a British education and are raise around British culture, and so have developed better critical thinking skills and understanding of the world than their average Syrian counterpart, so although I would not consider these refugee/migrants ever British, their children could be, as opposed to sending them home where their children will be born into deprivation and conflict, and so more likely to become the next generation of militants. I may very likely be termed a cultural supremacist, but I am not racist at all, I think interbreeding is the best way to assure positive trajectory, mongrelisation assures greater vigour and superior genetics, as can be demonstrated in all animals.	1	test

300	Cynthia, no you are correct - but when you responded the way you did to the terrorist threat, we supported you. Now fast forward a few years, and we have OUR citizens being killed on our streets, and on the beach when they are on holiday. We also have terrorists being recruited from within our own country - plotting against us, and going to Syria to fight for ISIS. With ISIS openingly declaring they will send more terrorists to Europe disguised as refugees, are you still saying we should keep our borders open? I can't fly to LAX without security checks, so I can't see that Syrians would be able to.. so why should it be any different for Europe than the US? (Of course, I fully expect you to ignore these questions, the same as every other time a yank comments on these threads does... but that proves the point really - you can talk a good game, but have nothing to back it up).	1	test

304	It's clear enough to anyone that would read the comments on here - or even just try to understand my last comment. I will repeat - we have terrorists killing our citizens NOW - and we have terrorists in THIS COUNTRY plotting to kill our citizens NOW. We also have people recruiting muslims in this country to go and fight alongside ISIS right NOW. I have never said I hate Muslims - I hate terrorists, period. I hate extremists and fundamentalists that want to harm us, and our society, regardless of their race, religion, or ideology. You may have a right to be more concerned about your own citizens than immigrants - I do not know enough about US crime stats.. but that doesn't mean the situation is the same here. As I said, you wouldn't let me fly to LAX without passing security checks, so (in view of the ongoing threat we live with on a daily basis) why should we let anyone they want to walk in to Europe?	1	test

Can you not see that the current situation is being used to rid you of any responsibility? If the refugees were in camps in Turkey etc, the UN would call on you to help... if they are artificially dispersed the UN can avoid a crisis, and the US can wash it's hands.	1	test
311	Cynthia, to show you how it should be done.. I will answer your question... Of the current refugees, I don't have a clue. But I know we have committed to taking 20,000 from source - ie those in camps, and we have given more aid than anyone else in Europe... and one third that of the US, from a country with 1/6th the economy (so comparatively, it has cost us twice as much as you).	0	test

351	The major thing I have learned from this'migrant-crisis' is that I now know where my vote will go in the forthcoming Referendum on the EU. I will vote to leave because, like many people here who won't admit it, the thought of the UK being in some 'club' with the Germans made many feel secure; the Germans, after-all, were the clever ones whose economy was up-and-away soon after WW2, while we lagged behind for many years. However, the way they have behaved over this crisis - handing out 'sweets' to migrants etc, is symbolic of their encouragement for the migrants to travel all that way; and absolutely ridiculous - and not a thought for their own people.

376	Hungary is handling it correctly, but Mad Merkel totally messed it up in creating a stampede and EU needs to do more to keep them nearer their border by improving facilities & supplies to persuade them NOT to travel to EU because it will be fine for them where they are now in Turkey and other neighboring Islamic States that have already setup Refugee camps for them. WHAT REALLY IS NEEDED IS A FULL SCALE WAR AGAINST ISIS WITHIN SYRIA & IRAQ, and once done all those so called migrants & refugees can be sent directly back to their country of origin. This will avoid another major recession due to the EU has no jobs for them, and therefore they will remain for years on State benefits while being feed, sheltered, educated and given some spending money which will destroy the social welfare system completely! ALSO, the fact that we don't know how many ISIS members & staunch supporters of them have now or will soon be infiltrating the EU & US, as many of the ones arriving have no form of identification to confirm whom they are!

405	Eszter Bedo, I'm saying that closing the borders and setting up walls doesn't solve the problem. The problem is as follows: 1. Migrants are fleeing from middle east conflicts; 2. They entered the EU in Greece; 3. They were invited by Ms Merkel; 4. Hungary build walls. The law says that the refugees should be registered in the country they enter first. This is neither Croatia nor Hungary. It is Greece. Where they registered there? No! EU law? Is there anywhere in the EU law stated that borders should be protected by walls and fences? No. And yet, Hungary is building like crazy. In the light of my points 1 to 4, all refugees heading for Germany should stay in Croatia and Serbia, because Hungary decided to build walls. Croatia is not acting in accordance with the law simply because Greece and Hungary decided to breach it first. You have no right invoking the law when you are breaching law also.	0	test
406	Thanks for your comment and I partially agree with you. I am also glad to see that a conversation is possible even if we have different views. There may be a law against a fence which I dont know about but I doubt that there is. If I am wrong and there is why is there a fence in Calais? If there is no law then Hungary didnt breach the law migrants can still enter the border and go through registration. Prior to this I was also thinking that the problem is in Greece but looking at the situation in Hungary and they sheer amount of people I can see why the fragile Greek economy cannot protect its borders and register people. To be honest they needed help well before this happened. And yes, the fence is not an answer on the long term and I dont think it will be up if the situation can be controlled in any other more sensible ways. However, people break through polce lines and it is physicaly impossible to establlish border control without it. You will soon see that people enter your country getting into Croatian citizens gardens and blocking train stations and motorways and making it impossible for people to go to work for example. Also what is really sad that Hungary has been criticised by Croatia that we were not prepared and Croatia will handle the situation better and look what happened! I still hope that a common solution will be found and neighbourhing countries will not turn on each other. Hungary has been critices left, right and centre without any help from our neighbourghs....	0	test

408	On this one I totally agree with you.	0	test
409	Eszter - I will paraphrase a (very long) response I posted on Gergely Dian's comment thread.... Basically everyone has failed eastern Europe. 1) The refugees should not have left the countries they escaped to - the UN should have made sure they stayed in the camps, and were registered. 2) Merkel basically sent out an invite to a free party in Germany, and slammed the door in the faces of people who turned up, because her house was full. 3) With nowhere to go, the refugees were stuck in Hungary, who quickly worked out they couldn't handle the numbers, so did the same as Germany, and stopped them coming in... thus pushing the problem further back down the line. The problem is when you plug one hole in a dam, it doesn't stop the pressure building up, it will just break out somewhere else - like Croatia or Serbia. So Eastern Europe as a whole is in a no-win situation - if you individually keep them out, you are called inhumane, even if you can't cope with the burden. If you decide to let them through, you are technically breaking the law. The solution I proposed was let those already moving go to Germany and register, and ensure those in camps or those leaving Syria stay in the camps and register. The UN will then be able to oversee their rights are upheld (shelter and food - even if that means camps in Germany, Austria etc.), or that the refugees are resettled as appropriate. However the only way that would work is if it is a temporary solution, and the refugees are able, and actively encouraged to return home at the earliest opportunity. {As it happens, the paraphrasing still turned out to be quite long - sorry :) }	0	test
410	Can I also add, I agree 100% that it is nice to be able to have conversations with people who don't agree on everything - makes a refreshing change on these posts...	0	test
411	Simon, I can see where you are comming from and there is a lot I can agree with you on. I just want to add that if Hungary didn't send the migrants to Germany or put a stop on numbers passing through Hungary by enforcing border controlls nobody would have taken it seriously till to this day. My biggest concern is that according to current estimates only 20-30% of the will get refugee status and those who won't will be asked to return home. I am not sure if you have seen the reaction when people were stopped and asked to register but you could see lots aggression and violence. What will happen when they are encouraged to go home? I can't even imagine their reactions. And will they? The EU is notoriously bad at returning refugees to their country of origin. I am still thinking border control is the way forward but not only in Hungary but all the way along. If we suppose that they can return to their countries after it is safe then refugees must be helped (by the enitre EU) as close to their home as possible. Also it would discourage those who are not running from war to stay at home and dont risks their life. If you cannot protect the border you soon won't be able to protect not even EU citizens but the real refugees who need help. My other problem is that at this stage EU is talking about quotas, migrants and refugees and to be frank we don't even know who is who and have estimated numbers at this point. Why do we have to transport people to Germany and find out there that they are not even refugees then retunr them back? It is not fair on them and not fair on the EU. And a side note..... it would be great to see some balanced reporting in the media as well and not making the situation worse by picking on certain countries like Hungary when to be honest nobody can handle the situation.	1	test
412	"Eszter - I agree with you 100%, in the ideal world. But let's say everyone agrees to implement 100% border control at midnight tonight - with the numbers we are seeing, countries in eastern Europe will struggle to give the aid that is needed (even if the refugees were to behave and abide by the law). That is why I said about letting the ones moving get to Germany - so the burden falls on the country, or countries that can handle it, until the UN takes over. As for genuine refugees vs illegal immigrants... that is another reason to pass the problem on to Germany, because eastern Europe couldn't undertake the burden of repatriating the illegals. The only way to fix the problem is stop the flow at source, and let the rest get to somewhere better equipped. Your second concern (about knowing who is who, and where they are) is a major issue for Europe that I feel will come back to haunt Europe. I believe Hungary have already arrested at least one member of ISIS, so how many more have just disappeared - and even without the terrorist threat, how many ""undesirables"" or criminals have taken the opportunity to simply vanish? As I said before the situation descended into a great big cluster fk - compassion is one thing, but it looks like western Europe totally lost it's mind, and didn't think a single thing through."	1	test
413	Nice to see that normal discussion is possible. Hopefully, this will be the case on the next summit of EU Council. The refugees should be transported as soon as possible to the country that invited them (Germany). The problem needs to be resolved politically on the EU level, with the clear call for the full scale military action against ISIS.	0	test

415	"I agree that some contries are better equipeed at dealing with the situation but looking at the news from Germany they are seem to struggle at this point too. Anyway, my point is that a clear message should be sent that only refugees can go to Germany and the EU which may discourage people to embark on this journey at all. If they see that somehow getting to the EU will enable them to go to Germany they will try their luck. As much as I am aware of a train was stopped many times in Germany by pulling the emergency handle and migrants jumpped off the train and disappeared. How can you make sure that they will go back then? I still think that we can bring the ""equipment"" to the people rather than the people to the equipment. Costs less time and money. I am not sure if it was a really a terrorist or not so I cannot comment on that, I heard about it but I am really not sure how reliable the info is. There is certainly a risk and that is why I am saying stop everyone where they are and find out there and then. If the EU is one unit it doesn't matter so the funds and resources can go to where the problem is. I also think that Germany should take more responisbilty about the situation due to the message that was sent out (funnily enough that was a rather vague statment which now can be altered according to the situation - but lets move on about it) Than it is possible to talk about quotas and numbers. On Verdans point what I can see is that the communication between member states are really poor, everyone included, and this issue is highlighted it big time."	0	test

435	"Horváth Endre You are experiencing the same issue I see on these threads, countless times per news item. Namely people read something, or hear something and repeat it as fact, when it is only an opinion. When asked to justify it they can't, because the proof doesn't exist. The ironic thing, at least as far as the UK is concerned, is the left-wing call the public ""sheep"" for believing what they read in the press, yet don't seem to notice the same traits in themselves."	0	test
436	It's the case in every county it seems. The same is true along the whole migrant route, maybe for whole of Europe ( not just EU). But I like a good argument, even if proved wrong. So, my hopes were high when someone posted that he checked his facts and shared a document proving me wrong.	0	test
437	Hmmmm... I am getting cross... I have just read that Syria launched air attacks against IS, or whatever they call themselves. My question is WHY haven't Syria formed an ARMY...??? This is an important issue because lots of their young men are running away... WHY are they not in an army...? WHY should they look for a 'better life' in Europe (and the UK) when we had to fight for our way of life, with death and injury affecting our families...??? Now with US and Russia involved, it seems to me that WW3 is approaching... I SUGGEST that Europe (and the UK) accept women, with their children, as refugees. All other people should be regarded as illegal immigrants and sent to Syria, no matter where their origin, to fight in their army to achieve a 'better life' for themselves...	1	test

Croatia is carrying the illegal immigrants to Hungary (as Serbia did it before) - daily more than 10 000 immigrants. Croatia doesn't defend its border, they don't deserve the membership of the EU. That's the Southern Slav mentality. (when they should do something, they don't do anything - as it happened so many times in the history) Hungary is the only country that keeps the rule of Schengen. We register and supply the illegal immigrants. We ensure that there isn't humanitarian catastrophie. The European Union let us again alone. It takes daily 1 billion Hungarian forint but we don't get any support from the EU. As the fence will be ready from Serbia to Slovenia, Hungary closes the border again and nobody will enter to us. Approximately 2000 Hungarian soldiers are building the fence and 3000 police officers look after the order. It would be nice if you reader from England, Germany, France and from all the countries of the world, never forget which country was the only tower against the illegal muslim horde! Don't believe to your press that is constantly crying for the ""refuggess""! They are constantly lying to you day to day! Greetings from Hungary!"	1	test

502	No, we don't think that Hungary is expert in anything, except in building fences and spreading xenophobia. The problem originated from the lack of proper control at border crossing between Turkey and Greece. When the migrants have entered the EU there, it is only a matter of time when will they end where they want and there is no way to get them back to Syria now. Army and fences will solve nothing. Only a plan on the EU level with the exact quotas for each country can solve the problem. Nationalism, racism, and widespread xenophobia, as promoted by PM Orban will make things only worst.	1	test
503	Your answer is according to the typical liberal mainstream. Just wait for other's help but doing nothing. Oh yes, we can say you are politically correct, Merkel and the other liberals will applaud for you. Nice! Just forget 1 thing: Croatia shoulnd't check there border? Why do you let come in to the EU the illegal immigrants without any controll? Or do you think that you haven't any responsibilty? Wake up!	1	test
504	Another point - if we close the border with Serbia, what exactly should Serbia do? Handle all 150.000 migrants by itself? Or start mass executions?	0	test
506	Than they must stop the smuggling what they are constantly doing! If the countries where the illegal immigrants movements happen now, make physical barriers than they can't enter into the EU. Paralell the greek navy should stop the immigrants on the see and defend the Schengen border. If all the countries are only waiting for something than this invasion won't stop which can be easily the end of Europe. That's all.	1	test
507	We anticipated not more then 1500 migrants per day. Within the first 24 hours more 17000 refugees came. But this is irrelevant. This problem can be solved not within the EU, but only in the Middle East. All NATO countries should assemble and send serious and decisive military force on the Middle East. Full scale military intervention against ISIS is what can save EU, not closing borders and shooting refugees. We need to start with serious actions against terrorist and stop building walls between us.	0	test

525	Dear Martina - they are migrants they moment they leave a safe country. True enough the ones that are in countries that border syria are refugees, but when you start marching across europe demanding entry into whichever country best suits your ambitions, you turn YOURSELF into an economic migrant. Could anyone actually give me a justification for continually arguing a point that has been explained to you time and time again? All these posts on here turn out the same way - the same trolls pushing the same message, yet never able to answer a simple question. Yes Egan and Andry, this directly applies to you. Given that the argument from them being called migrants is clear, what is the argument for them being called refugees when they leave a bordering country?	1	test
526	Actually, they're a mix of both, hence why they recently started using both terms in their news broadcasts. You need your head checking if you believe that they're all refugees, and the same can be said if you think they're all migrants.	1	test
527	A refugee must ask for asylum in the first country where there is peace. If they continue to migrate to other countries, not having a valid travel document, crossing borders in fields rather than the official way, they become illegal migrants and according to laws should be treated that way and deported. Very simple. Tell me where there is war all the way from Turkey to Germany, Sweden, UK? You might say Kosovo, perhaps. Other than that there is no conflict and no reason not to ask for asylum. That being said - not only they are they illegal migrants but illegal economical migrants. Those who really need help of any kind are not these, but those who suffer in kemps in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and even Egypt.	1	test

In ""Islamic"" Sharia a Muslim man is allowed to marry Christian & Jewish women and enslave ""athiest"" women to ""breed"" and bring in more Muslim offspring to the world, but a Muslim woman would be an adultress to marry a non-muslim - because a woman (and children) will be under the leadership of the husband, which in this case poses more than one ""Islamic"" dilemma. Muslims led many invasion in the past but they no longer need armes to invade Europe. They just need an army of young men to ""entre"" Europe and that will be it.

Hungary should be commended for showing people that its laws must be respected and that it is absurd to claim to be a 'refugee' and simultaneuosly 'force' (battling police, even if unarmed) your way into another country ... the real refugees from the Syrian civil war are in the refugee camps of Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey and deserve all the help necessary to provide them with the basic necessities of life and a chance to immigrate to another country by LEGAL immigration or return to their own country once the fighting has stopped and international assistance in rebuilding that country should be generously provided ... not least by the countries who took advantage of Syria's domestic problems (to reduce pressure on Israel to make peace with the Palestinians) and by their meddling (sending mercenaries) prolonged the fighting and caused many civilian deaths and most of the refugee problem ...	1	test
535	They only show snippets on TV, leading you to believe it's all about the women and kids. Wrong! This migrant situation is 75 % young men, going to Europe with a purpose in mind. They threw in a few woman and kids to make it look better. They were suppose to stop at the borders to have their papers checked, lots of them burned their passports. They threw the food they were given to the ground. These are Not refugees. These are Migrants intent on taking Europe. Germany should have never offered refuge to the mass exodus. All borders should be shut. How many Isis are in this group? The countries should only keep the women and kids plus the fathers, all the young men should be returned. Not that many Syrians but lots of other countries that are not even involved in fighting.	1	test
536	Hy. I am a hungarian and please, lets clear something. Hungary receive the migrants for months (4000-11 000 people per day). We give them water, food (which they dash against our policemans), blankets, clothes, medicines, toys. We also showed the disney tale for the kids in the East-Railway Station. Many hungarian voluntaries and policemans help them, but unfortunately nobody see these pictures in west. Yes, the government built a fence, because the migrants arrived ILLEGAL through the GREEN BORDER. The authorities could’t check them and catch the smugglers. Besides, the migrants trampled down the fieldlands, so they caused serious damages for the farmers. Please, don’t forget, the registration points are still OPEN. However, the migrants don’t want register. They don’t give fingerprint and many of them throw away their papers. They would like to go Germany immediately without any papers and become angry when they have to wait a few hours (or a day) for the next train. This situation cause the most conflicts with the police. Greece, Italy, Croatia don’t try register the migrants (maybe Slovenia do something). Now, IT IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. Hungary is the single country, which keep the schengen’ s rules. This is our responsibility. Currently, Croatia transport thousands of migrants with buses to the hungarian border. Yes, we take over them. We need to work TOGETHER. Please, stop blame Hungary for everything. Thank you. :)	1	test

552	The EU is bringing Europe to the brink. The Union is designed to maintain peace in Europe....but it's policy of forced diversity is starting to tear the continent apart. Only a small percentage of those traveling to the west are Syrian...and only a percentage of those are families. Just because Germany, France, Sweden, Belgium, Holland and Britain wishes to commit cultural and ethnic suicide by allowing uncontrolled numbers of non-White, non-Christian people in to their country....doesn't mean the rest of Europe has to.

557	Daily Mail (London) reports that a top Iman has told Muslims to use the migrant crisis to breed with European citizens and 'conquer their countries'. Sheikh Muhammad Ayed gave the speech at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem claiming Europe was only welcoming refugees as a new source of labour. He said Europe was facing a demographic disaster and urged Muslims to have children with westerners so they could 'trample them underfoot, Allah willing.' Birth rates are far higher in the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, which is where most migrants are coming from.The notion of using mass migration as a form of stealth jihad is outlined in the Koran, which states, 'And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah will find on the earth many locations and abundance.' To move to a new land in order to bring Islam is considered a meritorious GERMANY TODAY REVERSES WHAT MARTEL HAS WON FOR EUROPE. The Battle of Tours 1356, was fought on October 10, 732 between forces under the Frankish leader Charles Martel and a massive invading Islamic army led by Emir Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi Abd al Rahman, near the city of Tours, France. During the battle, the Franks defeated the Islamic army and Emir Abd er Rahman was killed. This battle stopped the northward advance of Islam from the Iberian peninsula, and is considered by most historians to be of macrohistorical importance, in that it halted the Islamic conquests, and preserved Christianity as the controlling faith in Europe, during a period in which Islam was overrunning the remains of the old Roman and Persian Empires. Now while ISIS is overrunning Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya, Germany is opening its borders to Syrians, and thereby what Charles Martel achieved for Europe has been made fruitless. These migrants cannot be compared to WWII refugees, for they were Europeans and they had no hidden agenda either to propagate their religion or to indulge in terrorist activities, as Atta & Co., did on 9/11 after enjoying everything in the West.	1	test

So decide it for your self...are they refugees or part of a new Jihad planed by ISIS. (The best way to get penetration in Europe)	1	test
581	Its Simple. the EU should tell Arabs if possible force them to take in the Refugees. then European countries can assist the middle eastern Refugees Camps financially and also provide aids for them so this desperate men and women wont be risking their lives in coming to Europe. also Europe should build boarders and make Hungarian Prime Minister the Head of the EU cause he is the only one with common sense on how to handle the migrants and refugees crisis	1	test

594	I realise that I look at things dfferently to others so here's my humble thoughts ... another way of looking at things. I am a mental health clinician and have contact with asylum seekers. I also see the struggles they have. These people want their home lands and their families, they don't want to be westernised and their culture made irrelevant. Many also suffer from PTSD and suffer on a daily basis. I had one man who was suicidal because he was unable to provide for his family in his home country and he could not contact family in UN camps apart from one member whom he was told would not be leaving the camp. This man cannot fit into a foreign society and do all he needs to to do this successfully when he cannot cope with his immense loss. IMHO I sincerely think we need to stop looking at these situations from our own points of reference and look at them from their perspective. What do they want and need. It's not being displaced and moved to foreign lands with little to no family. You see, cultures outside of western influence appear to value family relationships much more than we do. Look around us at our neighbours - the only extended families are those immigrants who could afford to come her and wanted to. Instead of putting a bandage on a haemorrhage, why don't we fix the problem. Instead of spending all that money to resettle people all around the world, why don't governments join together to despose those in power and causing this crisis. It wold make more sense to get rid of the problem and let people live in their country with their culture and family. I have much more thought on this but this is the gist of it. At the end of the day we westerners do what we would want, maybe we should ask what they want and need. cheers	0	test

After 4 years, 87% of syrians are unemployed. 9 groups are more criminal than the average. 8 of them are muslim. Even corrected for socio-economics. So in reality it is much worse. Overall more than half of all non-western immigrants are on welfare. Even counting those who have been here for decades. Somalis have an unemployoment rate of over 80% In Sweden, rapes are up 1500%.

671	Shauny... can you explain WHY they should use the word refugee? If you look at the UN definitions, a refugee is a person fleeing somewhere in fear of their lives, and a migrant is someone moving to improve their quality of life (usually to improve their economic position). Now, if we assume we are talking only about the syrians, and not the other people moving through Europe, they are undoubtedly refugees when they leave Syria. However, they then choose NOT to register in the UN camps, or with the authorities of the bordering countries, and they move on. That is when they become migrants - leaving one safe place for another to improve their quality of life. Whether they are entitled to or not is a different issue, I am merely asking why you think they should be called refugees regardless of where they are at the time...	0	test

687	"I wonder if it's possible for specific ""entrance"" points to be designated. The migrants would be properly sheltered at those points during which they would be ""processed"" (registered and given id and destination designation clarified) and then allowed to proceed to that destination. It would be a uniform process, accepted by all countries and clearly established as a uniform process for all migrants so they know if they cooperated in an orderly fashion they could be safe and enabled. This has nothing to do with the issue of quotas, just a concern for serving the best interest of people."	0	test

Why do these migrants get to demand where they can ""settle?"" I understand that some are fleeing; however, most are looking for a better life from their refugee camps in Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, etc. But there is an order and process that they need to understand and follow. If that basic concept is not understood, then they are going to have a hard time settling anywhere. Demanding to enter, not registering, throwing rubbish everywhere, damaging property, fighting, protesting, going on a hunger strike, etc. is not going to help their situation.

744	Dear BBC News For that crisis Croatia is not guilty... agreement was that Croatia can be transit country, everyone around us agree. What Hungary, Slovenia and Austria done? Close border... what Hungary and Slovenia expect of our Prime Minister Milanovic and of Croatia? To be fools for them?... They angry because we partially close our border but they close their borders with wire and walls! They can close but we can't!!!!!! What the hell they were thinking? Croatia can't handle with hundreds of thousands refugees, we can't hold them here because they want to go on north... Most of Croatians don't have something to eat but we help as much as we can. So... push Slovenia, Austria and Hungary to open their borders and let refugees to go where they want. They just can't stuck in Croatia. If no one want them, why they think that refugees can and must stay in Croatia!!!!!!!! Are we again become someone else's fool? If countries around us will close their borders for real, we also will close our Croatian border.	1	test
746	We maybe not the best country but we are not stupid! You said rule of EU! Are the closing border with wire by the rule of EU?

You are mocking with all of us when you close your border. I admire you for that action because I understand why but why you expect of Croatia to do somsone else's job.... Agree was - Croatia transit country! All you around suddenly close your border. Are you register all of them? We can handle with maybe thousands per day not with ten thousand per day. Many of refugees don't want to register and now what? The same news we read from Hungary and now we are guilty? Why? Why you close your border and we can't? Are you all aware that we have 300 thousands of unemployed, many thousands who work and not receive a sallary, many homeless and now, in a great european spirit you all expect of us to take care of hundreds of thousands refugees while you made a fun of us with your closed border????

We cannot force anybody to register but if they do want to they can the registration stations are still there. If they dont register they cannot enter the country. So you think Croatia is doing Hungary's job? Then dont talk about great European sprirt because you are contradicting yourself....

Croatia is not in the same situation - we are surounded with countries who close border and not allow refugee crossing... EU just can't expect of us to do job what we all had to do from the beginning and we can't accumulate refugees in Croatia because suddenly all of you find out that is a bit too much of them. I'm contradicting? Europe is thought to cheat Croatia again and turn Croatia into a ""collection center for refugees"" - because what else will mean close all borders around us and suddenly the EU rule - no new corridors? You forgot - Hungary had open coridor during the long period before closing border!!!! I have a right not to be contradicting because I'm not - I have the righ to be very angry. Solution for a problem is - all states can open border and one rute can go through Hungary, one through Croatia... or we all can help Greece to close land and sea borders or.... there is many solution but no will. Eszter... Hungary as a country is a great, I really have nothing against you and I just even admire border act you done but this just not right toward Croatia.... We are also knows read and listen when foreign politicians or common people talk and we know add up 2+2... Closed border around us, EU rule - no new refugee coridor... we must be stupid enough to not figured out what that all mean!

Refugees, no to be a refugee you have to stop at the first safe country and seek asylum that would have been Greece or Italy.if you proceed you are a migrant and if you have not got papers , passports or any id you are an illegal migrant, however as Ty Royce Weldon says they are the single greatest threat that the western world have 9/11 to remind you in your country, brits killed on a beach in Tunsia recently bombings and be headings, As you say there is bad in each culture very true but this lot rank in top place for total disregard to life did I mention the use of chemical weapons , If this were America I am sure the Americans would want to vet these people before taking them into their country, but in fact they are better to remain in their own cultural land and should really be taken in by other Mislim countries and not be given out handouts and maps to the promised land they already have it its called Syria and as we see all these pictures of a males forcing their way up Europe like a riot mob when ever stopped and asked for ID , they should be fighting for their home land to forge a future for their families , a great majority of these peope need sending back to a safe area and if refugee? go through the right international procedures .but this is just plain lawlessness.	1	test

805	The reasons why 50% of nurses and doctors are foreign is to deal with the influx of large amounts of immigration since 204 . If you removed 50% of those immigrants and then reduced immigration to pre 90s levels then those foreign doctors and nurses would become surplus to requirement	0	test

990	There are plenty of neighbouring wealthy countries to Syria. Why are they not taking in refugees?? I am all for helping people in need but the UK is struggling enough financially as it is without bringing hundreds of thousands more people in who will need homes (we are already short), school places (we are already short), hospital treatment (already understaffed and run into the ground) and benefits (massively overstretched already).	1	test

1023	Well Yeshua (Jesus) is the way. I am nor worried about the world because Yeshua will come back and Yah will destroy all evil.	0	test
1024	The trouble is Micky, is that half of those who are coming are not refugees. There are others from middle eastern countries who are abusing the refugee crisis, to get here also!! ...Also, there is a threat that ISIS have planted their own fighters among refugees to harm us and quite frankly, it is rather stupid of countries to let them in, so long as ISIS remains a world presence.	1	test
1025	Yes totally understandable Donna, was not the same said about the Irish? Also the blacks, wow that was bad look at them now.. upon how they was viewed, it's just a recycling scenario of what's already been seen.

1041	Don't use Christmas as a Propoganda tool either!! Anyone putting their childrens lives at risk to enter a country, when they were for four years safe in another country is scum in my eyes!!!!......There is a very real threat that ISIS fighters are among these people, which could well result in MORE innocent children dying. Yet nobody seems to be thinking across those lines, particularly not our governments!! What happened to that young child is terrible, a tragedy.....but do we want more dead children in the UK at the hands of terrorists ?? ......NO!!!!!!......We could avoid more innocent deaths on either side, if Saudi Arabia opened its doors to these people.	1	test
1042	RIP Aylan and Galip Kurdi and the 3500 other refugees including children currently at the bottom of the Med. To all those who constantly wrote nonsense on here daily for months like 'shoot them all' or 'sink the boats', I hope you're proud of yourselves. I will never understand all the venom on this page.

1048	Yeah, it will go a long way toward destroying out way of life. Liberal progressives don't understand that hatred has consequrces, as does compassion. That's why humans have brains. To sort through all the bs.	0	test

1051	Elcan - not literally freeze as it obviously depends on where in the world they are but they will suffer. You try braving poverty, hunger and weather conditions while living in a tent.

1052	Karen Elizabeth Evangelista its been proven that Saudi, Turkey and USA were financing mercs to fight against the legal government in Syria(Assad). Saudi wants the entire region islamic, USA wants the oil and gas. Saudi spent 4yrs destabilizing that region, and now, we are seeing the results of their work, while they build a 1000k wall around Saudi to keep everyone else out..so much for the leaders of the UNHCR-no rights unless you are shia-and the new leaders of the global terrorism gang	1	test

1056	All I ever see on the Daily Fail are humans but no humanity. All I said was RIP to the 3500 dead refugees including children floating in the Mediterranean and that showing compassion to those less fortunate because their lives have been destroyed and their houses bombed would make you a decent human being. I'm sick of all the constant hatred and divide. Human beings are dying over needless wars. I knew I'd get trolled for writing a human comment. Some things never change on this page.	1	test

1059	Amandeep Lallie. As you are so sick of gatecrashing into comments on the British newspaper, you obviously know the answer and that is to piss off.	1	test
1060	Karen - I never understand a word you say. You comment on absolutely everything but never make any sense whatsoever. You're the biggest troll around here even if it is unintentional. You're just a vile woman. I've also repeatedly told you I'm not from India, I'm British yet you still harp on about me involving myself in British affairs. I can comment on a British newspaper as I'm British you dumb woman.	1	test
1061	Yes I understand what you are saying as you Karen are racist. Every post I write on you call me 'Indian' and use it as an insult. You can't even tell the difference between nationality and ethnicity. I was born in England. My parents were born in England. I've never been to India yet your racist mind can't get past the colour of my skin. I'm British whether you like it or not you racist bat. You judge people based on skin colour and ethnicity even though it's completely irrelevant to what they're saying, which is to be a decent human being. My points are clearly lost on you as you're not a decent human being.	1	test
1062	AND for the FINAL TIME - how many Syrian people have you personally taken in, or your family taken in?

F*cking useless.	1	test

1065	Well you find it funny Elcan but you do realise that in the racist mind of Karen - you're 'Indian' so according to her logic 'not British' and not welcome right? Word of advice - don't associate yourself with racists and small-minded bigots unless you are one yourself.	1	test
1066	Karen is a vile human being who only likes white people. Imagine her surprise when she will actually see a Syrian child for the first time only to be perplexed at how fair and 'white' their complexion is... Would blow the racist buffoon's mind. Karen - why don't you google 'Assad's children' and see how white they look. Doubt your small mind would be able to handle the shock.	1	test
1067	Oh wow I just noticed that Karen has deleted her vile rant where she said I'm stupid and uneducated and I'm Indian and not British and blah blah blah, which warranted my reply to educate the racist troll and teach her the difference between nationality and ethnicity. No backbone whatsoever. She spews racism and bigotry and hatred and then deletes it. At least leave your vile views up for all to see as you clearly stand by them.	1	test
1068	Yes they will because they're are fleeing 1000 of miles to 'safety' when there is refuge for them not far away	1	test

I'm so sorry for your loss, Mr Kurdi but charity begins at home. Britain must help their own first. Britain is not the worlds bank manager!	1	test

This sacrifice is not about safety any more it's about going to a country to find a better life FOR FREE and AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS who already live in that country as has their generations of family and continually paid in to it, without trying to fight for their own. Of course losing children and any other part of the family is an horrendous thing, but that's where my pity ends and I have no sympathy apart from that.	1	test

While I feel badly for the innocent refugees, my own safety and the safety of my loved ones must come first so until the a better job of weeding out the killers can be done, and it's pretty obvious as shown by recent events that it's it's not being done now, the refugees are not my priority.	1	train

My ex called me, I was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said was that he was so sorry for everything that happened, that she wanted me to return to him, that he loves me so much. I was so happy and went to him, that was how we started living together happily again.

1410	"So their story is tragic, indeed, but goes as follows: after war in their country they flee to the nearest safest place due to force majeure and seek refuge, for example in Turkey, where they also have an international legal status as refugees. Then, they don't like it there, for whatever reason, even though they are perfectly safe as refugees, and decide to illegally immigrate and walk or are driven by smugglers for 1700 km across Turkey's land to subsequently cross the sea into Greece, putting in danger their own and their children's lives by bringing more unnecessary treacherous hardship and toil unto themselves, utterly and wholly of their own accord. Meantime the media still calls them euphemistically ""refugees"" ad infinitum, long after they have chosen to do away with their legal status as refugees given that they immigrate illegally to other counties without being in any immediate danger, in fact even though they do not qualify as ""refugees"" in any sense of the word once they cross Turkey's border into Greece, neither in the legal sense under all international treaties, nor in the etymological sense; simply because for at least 1700-1900 km of land maybe way more and a stretch of rough sea with the help of an illegal smuggler whom they themselves paid, they illegally immigrate into a country two or ten borders seat from the one they had initially sought refuge into. So the small question is why are the media still all calling them refugees after they reach Greece, when CLEARLY BLATANTLY they are NOT in any sense of the word, legal or etymological or otherwise (compassion is not an excuse for bad journalism of forging skewed opinion shaping public perception). Are you saying that they are running away from dire danger while they are in Turkey, to which they initially sought refuge to, qualifying the use of the term as refugees due to force majeure into Greece? And the big question is: there are over 2.5 billion people with similar or more tragic circumstances. Should they be allowed to immigrate illegally to any country they please? What about Somalian children and people in general? They actually have it worse than Syrians in all respects, plus they don't make demands for halal food. Wanting their life back which was destroyed by war is understandable. But so do another 2.5 billion people around the world with similar or worse circumstances. Should they all be allowed to immigrate illegally into Europe just because the media arbitrarily label them as refugees long after they are no longer refugees nor, in veritable fact, seeking refuge into safety not running away from any danger, perceived or real?"	1	train

1414	Paul, what's your argument exactly? What is it exactly that you disagree with, specifically?	0	train
1415	I agree 100%, Turkey is regarded as a safe country, along with the other countries that have been deemed safe and secure in search of Western Europe. Remember the scenes in Austria, Hungary and Croatia? The videos of food and water supplies being chucked onto the railways by adult males, rejecting hospitality. They were safe in Turkey and risked their lives all for what? By the time they get here they've lost family members, children, babies, and for what? Safety? Security? You had that. And you lost them because of your naivety to travel to Western Europe in search of the safety that you already had in Turkey, and other countries along the path.	1	train
1416	"Arbitrarily labeling them refugees and helping them illegally immigrate is as logical as allowing any person with tragic circumstances go through the USA south border and offering them assistance ""for the hardship they endured"" while they were trying to get there (which is what NGOs are doing in Greece, effectively being assistance to illegal immigration). They are in NO danger, perceived or otherwise, while they are in Turkey, a country to which they initially sought refuge, so what are they seeking refuge away from by suffering so much to get into Greece and Europe? So who is promoting all this? The media and NGOs are all in subversive collusion against the very idea of ""nation"", never mind ""state"". There have been numerous wars in the middle east before. Why is this mass surge of illegal immigration happening now and is also being justified by the media as necessary, for that matter ? No Palestinians, no Lebanese, no Egyptians, no Lybians fled en masse into Europe, but they have had war just the same in very recent years. Walking from Syria to Greece: 1600 km from Aleppo. Walking from Iraq to Greece: 1750 km from west Iraq. Where are all the Iraqi people?"	1	train

I'm ""anti-accepting-illegal-immigrant"" and ""anti-arbitrarily-labeling-illegal-immigrants-as-refugees"". To give you an example: we're bringing 25,000 Syrians into Canada and I'm quite happy about that. The most important thing though is that they will enter legally, with proper checks and naturalization through immigration authorities. So even though the media are having their little jamboree orgasm clasping on the term ""refugees"" into Canada (LOL), they are in veritable truth LEGAL IMMIGRANTS in this case, nonetheless; and whose tragic circumstances justify expedient, albeit legal, immigration should they please to do so. Most importantly, they are NOT seeking refuge into Canada away from war if they are departing from Turkey, unless they are air lifted or ferried straight from Syria, into Canada. In other words, they are NOT refugees even in the case of Canada. Do you find the term ""refugee"" sexier or something compared to ""immigrant""? because the term"" refugee"" applies only in specific contexts and circumstances. Does it connote more compassion in your view or something? Because I find it's being used as a blanket statement to force illegal immigration as something desirable and normal, which it shouldn't. So what exactly is it that you find is being implied as ""conspiracy""?"	1	train

Mr Greek Canadian, wow, Canada is taking 25,000 now a liberal govt has been elected... background checks are being done on people with no documents? Good luck with that. A refugee is someone with legal status defining them as a refugee. So Canada will accept REFUGEES. As for me, I'm British living in Austria, I am a MIGRANT to you, an IMMIGRANT to Austrians and an EMMIGRANT to Brits. As for Egyptians, Libyans and Palestinians, there are many recent arrivals in the EU, your facts are out... Syria had one of the biggest Palestinian refugee camps outside of the occupied territories.

Begging is a very big annoying, unpleasant and ultimately harassing thing but you are mistaken if you think that the refugees will integrate quick and without any issues and be forever grateful to their European Savior. They are faced with bureaucracy right now, procedures and this makes them mad and feeling disregarded. They have some high expectations and a very different perception of Europe and what Europe has to offer. The idea that once the refugees together with their families arrive in Austria, Germany, etc they will have a job in a matter of hours/days is unrealistic. The reality of the matter is that the whole process takes time, and after what they have endured they don't have any more patience which is understandable.Contrary to what most of people think most of the refugees will despise their ""European Savior"" if we keep ignoring some core issues and congratulating ourselves for being so accepting."	1	train

The fact that you actually decided to publicly attack and deride Greeks for what their country is going through regarding their economy, just because you ASSumed I'm Greek (as though Greeks don't have a right to tell people what is objectively true or not just because, as you said their economy is in tatters), when in actuality we are talking about: a) refugees and Syrians fleeing their country into Turkey where they are safe from war and b) their illegal immigration into Greece and Europe, and c) whether the media should continue to label illegal immigrants as refugees, is utterly schizophrenic in your part my friend and proves exactly how terribly messed up your way of thinking really is. As for Greeks, since you mention, given the fact that about 10,000 have died due to the economic crisis, and over 200,000 have legally immigrated due to the economic downturn also, that's all the more reason not to compound the Greek problems and incapacity to offer help by burdening Greece with the largest number of illegal immigrants in Europe. I seriously doubt that American people are to blame for their mess. I seriously doubt that French people are to blame for their mess. I seriously doubt that Greeks are to blame for the mistakes and betrayal if their politicians and the stupid laws they pass and agreements they made and borrowed money they used. You are a dumb, ignorant bastard. I hope all the ""refugees"" come to your posh neighborhood in Austria. Then you will stfu. You are a bigoted racist. ==== Canada will accept mostly immigrants. The media, and morons like you, will keep calling them refugees because it's a sexier news headline. Enjoy Vienna built only in Greek style architecture. One of the most racist and Nazi cities in Europe, and the only country in Europe that has received the LEAST number of immigrants labeled refugees... It's easy for you to judge ask other countries.. I hope you are deported back to Britain by Austrian authorities so that your place is given to a Syrian family in need. They need it more than you do anyway, and have far more grounds to immigrate to Austria than you did, in your logic."	1	train
1428	"Will Moreton: HOW DARE YOU? How dare you? Greeks didn't create any war in the middle east. They haven't in the least bit, neither directly nor indirectly instigated any of the problems facing Syria. Yet Greeks are carrying almost the entire burden of illegal immigration into Europe almost singlehandedly, when in fact the very countries responsible for the crisis in Syria and the middle East in general, including Britain where you're from, which has been a global cancer with its imperialism are doing nothing. Greece hasn't caused this flux of immigrants. Yet Greece is handling almost all of them. But Britain has had a significant involvement in the middle east and Syria to say the least. I think it's only fair to take in a few ""refugees"" from Lesvos island and move them to Britain, to turn your village in Britain into something like you argue Greece deserves (for its politicians being idiots, and causing the crisis, in your logic). I'm glad you told the world what an horrible racist you are by finding an arbitrary excuse based on my name alone to be spewing your hate about Greeks when we're talking about Syrian immigrants and Syrian refugees being incorrectly labeled as such by the media who incorrectly use the terms interchangeably. There are Greeks who have it just as bad, if not worse than some Syrians who can afford 5000 euros to pay their smuggler into Greece, as they live in abject poverty in the streets of Athens, eating from garbage bins and rendered homeless through no fault of their own. You should go and see, instead of speaking out of your puckered British asshole: the nation that has fucked this planet time and again. How dare you, you despicable bigoted subhuman?"	1	train

1431	"Well, wherever I'm from, please justify how I'm racist? That's a nice argument coming from someone trying to muddy the waters between refugees and ""illegal immigrants"", I note with interest you haven't taken issue with my comments about Bulgarians... You'll note I also said ""most Europeans"" and compared refugees with professional beggars... you really should be careful about overreaction. For your information I'm an internationalist and see no reason for any borders (incidentally, neither do the rich or corporations, so why should the poor suffer them?) Yet again, you need a lesson in terminology and are missing the concept of refugee status. Immigrants are usually given indefinite leave to remain or a contractual period of time, refugees (such as the syrians coming to canada) will be given temporary leave to remain, and will as such be expected to return home as/when Syria is ""safe"". Syrians are not safe from war in Turkey, or have you missed the stories of multiple suicide bombings and revenge army attacks? Plus there's the point Turkey has as many refugees as the EU in a much smaller area... they're pushing on the Christian and Kurdish refugees. It's not schizophrenic, ""refugee"" is a legal term and Germany & Sweden have offered to take all Syrianss fleeing war. Hence, despite the legalities of entering Greece, as soon as they're registered they are legally refugees... until then let's say asylum seekers, as no one fleeing war or persecution shouldbe branded ""illegal"". As for Greece, Olga, sorry while I was attempting to prise a reaction from mr anonymous teacher there, i have nothing against Greeks, Bulgarians or Romanians per se, many Europeans do, and Bulgaria has elected a rather right-wing govt... Mr greek, As for dealing with these refugees, I do every week at work, and they're a friendly bunch that I've so far met... Vienna racist? :-D so the ""fluchtlinge wilkommen"" movement hasn't been reported then? While we're on the subject of history/historical places, shall we touch on the reasons the middle east is a shit storm now? Post WW1 the allies carved up the ottoman empire and drew lines in the earth to force people together in some areas where they hated each other, and apart in others where they potentially threatened western interests.... Cyprus is the largest testament to the active part the Greeks played in that theatre. Meanwhile, my family were enjoying a civil war in the Irish free state... easy to chuckaround labels, isn't it? So try not to label refugees in Europe ""illegal"" and maybe others won't point out how close countries close to your heart are skating to disaster."	1	train

How about you take it up with your government for failing to correctly tax the rich and actually seeing the state gets the money and put an end to the fakelaki system and the vastly overblown beaureaucracy amongst other things when the shit really started to hit the fan?

1557	It's not immigration that people have a problem with but having this many people arrive in such a small amount of time feels like an invasion. I think that's why people sound so heartless because they're scared.	0	train
1558	We are talking about thousands of people entering a country of milllions......not much of an invasion	0	train
1559	Not really. There's 2.5 million that entered a Greece of a 10 million population in a very short year and a half, with a much as half a million arriving in the last few months spine, accounting for 1/4th of its population all on small islands with towns half that of the size of Moncton. That's like saying by analogy 10 million people came to Canada all within a few months in the smallest of towns. If that had happened here, you'd be crying like a petty spoiled whiner that you are for not being able to drive through the streets. So stop being naive. This is as much a crisis for the illegal immigrants as it is for those locals whose lives they are destroying. You have it easy, and you pick and choose sides too easily based on your preconceived notions. There's utter chaos in these circumstances and nothing is cut and dry. What is more, there's evidence these people are being urged to immigrate into Europe instead of dispersing in the surrounding vicinity of their country that is safe and where they are welcome and where they don't have to travel for 1800 km and pay smugglers 5 thousands euros per head to get to Europe when they're not even running away from danger any longer. Worse yet, countries like UAE, which are Muslim, wealthier than Germany and Greece and Italy and France combined, and a mere 200 km away from Syria have closed their borders to their Muslim brothers. To give you a sense of how irrationally wild it is that they specifically want to come to Greece, get this: Iraq is roughly the same distance: 1890 km from Greece. Where are all the Iraqis from the war there? What about all the Palestinians? They are closer. What about all the Egyptians? They could have just skipped over the sea onto Crete when there was war in their country, but hardly anyone came. What about people from Jordan, they are closer too. Where are they? Libyans didn't come to Greece either. So what's up with Syrians? They are neither the first nor the last to have war. What's the deal with this mass exodus of only males? When the war in Bosnia took place, none came to Greece and they are much much closer by a few hundred km. When the war in Kosovo broke out, no one came either nor dispersed into Europe. When the war in Ukraine came, hardly any mass migration took place. When the war in Yugoslavia took place that created FYROM and the such, hardly anyone moved about yet again. The scenario with Syrians is a first in recent history. Don't be so naive. All these men are draft dodgers too. They should be fighting for their country as they are able bodied, young and healthy. Who will rebuild their nation. At best I find this mass exodus suspiciously curious for destabilizing both Syria and Europe. Start doubting the news they feed you for a change and ask yourself questions at all times.	1	train

1608	Well said, Graeme!	0	train
1609	"""Let's look after this country's homeless and elderly before anything else"" - Have you ever heard of this thing called the ""Welfare state""? The State pension is the UK's single biggest expenditure, followed closely by other entitlements like housing benefit. This country bends over backwards to help the elderly and the homeless, and the little support that migrants and refugees get is but the tiniest fraction of that. You might say ""well, benefits all go to immigrunts"", but you'd be wrong, as 95% of the welfare bill goes to British-born. ""How many are terrorists"" - Well, seeing as all major terrorist attacks in Europe over the last decade were carried out by people who were born in their target country, probably zero. ""What about the frail and elderly"" - See the earlier remark about pensions. ""What about the veterans that are too proud to ask for help?"" - If someone doesn't ask for help, it's very difficult to give it to them, isn't it. ""What about the victims of floods in Cumbria?"" - Households that've been flooded are being given £5000 each by the Government, plus expenses for temporary accomodation. Many may also be insured. In spite of their current misfortune, Cumbria flood victims are in a much better position than the majority of refugees. Saudi Arabia is a crackpot-theocratic dictatorship that still has public executions. Not a country to aspire to."	0	train

1648	I am taken aback by the negativity and ignorance on here from some contributors. Where is your humanity? How can you say, in all conscience, that we should not donate to help the refugees? I say, 'there but for the grace of God, go I' and I would hope, were I in their tragic situation, that kindness would prompt good people to help me and my family. Before you say to me that we should help our own first, I have done that, am doing that and will continue to do that in what ever way possible. I mention what follows purely to illustrate that I am not ignoring the need that exists here in this country. I am not blowing my own trumpet and I don't care what you think about me. I don't have a lot of money but I work and volunteer (including previously working for a homeless charity - my way of helping since I cannot donate huge cash amounts). I try to meet need where I find it in a small way. I have donated a gift filled shoe box for an elderly person in need; I am collecting tins of Christmas food for a food bank. I made a small donation to this collection - because it broke my heart watching the faces of the people struggling out of the sea and hearing their stories of people dying around them, and seeing the body of a little boy on the beach. Many of you sound angry. Anger is driven by fear. I'm frightened too - of the mess we're in here and in Syria and what might happen - but I will not let my fear turn me into someone who is incapable of helping others in desperate need - of what ever race or religion.

1728	"We should know that development and migration are intrinsically related, that the capitalist system inherently develops unevenly, that the British regime is part and parcel of economic policies imposed on poor countries through various means (IMF, World Bank, support of dictatorships, freedom of their corporations to plunder, etc, etc), that the same regimes have played a significant role in aborting the attempt of the same people fleeing ""their countries"" in overthrowing the oppressive system at home (see the so-called Arab Spring, the elections, the NGOs, etc) all in order to maintain the status quo. Then you wonder why people flee and drown in the sea. It's the failure of a certain capitalist modality in large swathes of the world. Capital, a thing, is free to migrate anywhere, but humans are not. so, thank you all of you, bunch of murder apologists and defenders of your own oppressive barbaric regime in Britain. instead of attacking the Regime here and its criminality against its own population you are finding a scapegoat as it is an easy target demonstrating your complicity in barbarism."	1	train

1733	A difficult concept for most people to understand is that - unless you are an asylum seeker, coming from the atrocities of war, which apparently many people lack any empathy to be able to understand, and in which case ANY country should grant you hospitality and support - those of us who come from EU (and parts of Asia, Africa, America, etc., from those areas not affected by extreme poverty and war), so in most cases not from starvation, come here to achieve excellence, to study, to build businesses, because UK is a country that rightly supports small businesses, a creative country in which education is valued. We want to create opportunities for others as well. We don't come to steal. We don't leave family and friends and a familiar home to be on benefits. That would hardly repay what we miss. If I have to be poor here I may as well be poor with my own family If some of us are on benefits it's because of an emergency situation (like it should be for everyone - it shouldn't be lifestyle - in theory), but aspiring to be out of it as soon as possible. Aspiring to earn and pay taxes. Aspiring to make British friends and give what we can.	0	train
1734	It seems like some of you guys value life on benefits like a sort of fancy lifestyle we all can't wait to join.....errrh not so much. I want a decent income, my own house, etc. like many other immigrants. Why would we move to be on benefits?	0	train

1741	Craig if you are so ashamed of Britain kindly f*ck off.	1	train
1742	I agree Craig McIntosh we have the same issue in Sweden, the problem is people dont like change, or strange things, or having to share. Many people also lack understanding, arent well traveled and hence immigration becomes this big evil that has to be stopped, and we throw these light fashist parties at the immigration to make the big bad thing go away. Even if imigration cant bet stopped, many countries have immigration to thank for what they are, even my country sweden during its prime in the 1600-1800 was built upp thx to foreigners, merchants from all over the world, craftsmen etc and others. I can agree that in many western countries the process of making a new arrived person blend into society painless isnt always working that well. Do we really need right wing extreme parties to solve that. It illustrates the need to education of people, politicians that are prepared to deal with issues, but also to work towards a society that is moore tolerant. Because the world today is in a period of change, much of the old order in the middle east and north africa are carving itself up. We have problems with more hostile neighbours in the east and people are emigrating in numbers not seen since ww2. Some people are also so fast to put numbers on other human beings, and this worries me, they would not do this towards one of its own, no matter what crimes or acts of evil they did, but an immigrant oh lord do they cost two bags of potatoes every month or will we taxpayers have to pay the ammounts of a lamborghini? It rubbs me the wrong way, and distract from the core issues with foreign policy, integration and the likes. Some have a tendency put even moore blame on the victims and its very dontraproductive to solve issues with imigration to begin with.	0	train

1750	"We have huge immigration in Canada as well. I'm not certain but I believe we welcome more immigrants to Canada than any other country. Our gov't tells us that we need immigration to replace our ""aging population"" as our birthdate is below the replacement rate. However I'm beginning to question the real motivation for why mass immigration is continually rammed down our throats. We can't even have a decent debate without accusations of racism- never mind the fact that immigrants come in white too. I'm beginning to believe that immigration does more harm than good in the short-term and it negatively impacts ""natives"" and even the second generation of long-established immigrants. First of all, while many immigrants are highly skilled/educated, we must ask why do we import skilled people?? Why are we no longer offering affordable training/post-secondary schooling to ""natives""? In Canada and the U.S., the costs of tuition is becoming more and more prohibitive and burdensome. It's not as ""easy"" for everyone to take on massive debts, that could take decades (yes, in some cases decades) to pay off. And why don't our governments care if its own people are educated?? Because keeping people ignorant and desperate means that they will tow the line. Govt's MUST invest in their own people and stop importing foreigners trained ""specialists."" Here in Canada we are experiencing wage stagnation and the loss of unionization. Somehow the average Canadian has been hoodwinked into believing that unions are useless and costly- even the U.S. has higher rates of unionization than us, albeit their union population is shrinking also. Immigrants tend to come from countries where a unionized workforce is unheard of and worker/human rights violations are rampant! So these people come here and, admittedly, they are willing to work the crap jobs that the average Canadian won't take. Why won't the average Canadian take these low-pay Wal-Mart jobs? Because one can barely survive on the wages!! The unskilled immigrants are usually desperate enough to take any work and they will do it without complaint. This allows our govts and businesses to keep the pay for low-skilled jobs at barely sustenance levels where people will likely never be able to seek out the training/education required to move up the societal rungs and it is increasingly likely that they never be able to put their children through college on such meager wages. However the fact that immigrants will ""happily"" do these crappy jobs, in turn makes the ""hard working"" immigrant laudable compared to the natives who are accused of being ""too proud"" to do low pay wirk. then the people who blindly support unfettered immigration, and accuse those who call for restraint ""racists"" and ""bigots"". Unskilled immigrants are not your ""heroes"" because they take on our shit work; often they are people who are used to poor, oppressive working conditions so they'll do the work that no one else wants. So in sum, our governments want to import two kinds of immigrants to the detriment of ""native"": ready-made skilled immigrants so that they can keep domestic tuitions expensive and out of reach for their own people. And the unskilled immigrants will do the crappy jobs because they have no choice and the odds are that Canada's shitty jobs are an improvement from third world factory work. I'm not any-immigration. But we need to fix domestic problems before we simply import disadvantaged people to do our slave work for us. Question the REAL reasons why our governments and big business love mass immigration. Is it really in everyone's best interest??"	1	train
1751	It's funny how your government makes you obsessed with immigration while silently taking away all your rights and privileges as citizens. They like to blame immigrants for all their failures as the leadership. While people on the bottom fight and argue with each other (locals vs immigrants, whites vs blacks, Muslims vs non-Muslims), your elite is seizing power and removing your only real power which is spending power. They are pushing house prices out of your reach so there's fewer landlords to control, the rest of people are pushed into a lifetime debt (payday loans, massive mortgages for those who can afford them, student loans at £9000 a year, energy prices up by 10% every year, less national healthcare so you pay privately etc..). Do you really think that when you leave the eu (the only body that protects your rights from becoming peasants and serving the elite in 'new monarchy') will somehow magically change your country into a promised land ? Ever heard of foreign business, foreign investment, globalisation, British exports and what really drives UKs economy (finance and business management)?

1823	I wished people would stop trying to be right on etc. The realities are that there is a finite number of people that our infrastructure and systems can cope with. Whether you want to be trendy leftie or not we cannot continue to allow all and sundrie to come. We don't have a housing shortage, we have a people excess. We can hardly manage with what we have, we really need to control our borders (the trendy leftie lovies among you please note I did not say close). Have you noticed the increase in floods etc, do you think that might have a tiny bit to do with concreting over more land than we should have, thus limiting drainage capacity? Even if you take the view that many come to work, and that is not disputed by me, the fact is most are low paid, meaning that in work benefits etc almost certainly means they are a net cost, and another job that could go to someone already here. Points based work visa system works elsewhere, it could be made to work here, but we would have to leave the eu, which is fine by me.	1	train
1824	The reality is the extra money required to maintain efficient infrastructure and NHS services is not 'available' by the government - stating that immigration and other issues is costing the government more money than it is, hence why it can't provide extra monetary resources. This is why more and more national resources require privatisation according the government to save money, and why the NHS is being primed for this. Just as an example...provisional data shows that there was a net flow of 163,000 migrants to the UK in the year ending June 2012...163,000. That is it, and that was taken from a government website. That total is 0.2% of the population (i went for 66mil as the pop of UK). Its not the migrants using benefits, because a lot of them/the vast majority are very hard workers and contribute massively to this economy...its the British people who think they are entitled to benefits because of a history of 'family entitlement' or think that is how life works - draining the benefits system (which should be a safety net, not something to live your life by). Drainage capacity? Stop paying farmers to keep their lands clean and clear, and pay them to grow more trees instead, that would help. Reforestation is proven to help combat flooding...but that is something else the government won't do. Leaving the EU...well, can't wait to hear your reaction the first time you want to go on holiday or travel over there if we did.

Net EU migration isn't nearly as big as the Kippers like to make out, they constantly ignore the £2million Brits who live and work in the rest of Europe and EU migrants contribute more to the UK economy than they take out.

1851	Trouble is that Britain needs the EU more, much more than the EU needs Britain. Even though the UK now has to pay two billion Euros to the EU according to the rules everyone, UK included, agreed to, without the special UK discount no other country is getting, itwould be almost double that. The UK is falling into the same trap we here in Switzerland are, we both think we're somehow special and the EU won't risk cutting ties with us but both countries may be proven terribly, catastrophically wrong.	0	train

1853	You won't. Trust me. No more free trade with the and that includes Banking. Your economy will implode. You are aware that 80% of the UK's GNP comes from trade of goods and services with the EU, yes? That'll go away pending renegotiation. There will be loads of available office space in London's City. You will have to negotiate each and every small item with them, just like Switzerland and it's tedious, very tedious.	0	train
1855	Oh it's getting really hard being Switzerland after the Banks' criminal business models got dismantled and the EU is getting sick and tired of Switzerland's cherry picking. Every negotiation is getting harder and the government has to make more concessions. The end result will be that we'll a lot of the same obligations as an EU member without having all of the benefits and above all, no vote. We'realready paying billions into the cohesion funds for new EU members and into various other EU funded projects so we can still take part in the European free market. We're not that special anymore. The UK, while being 8 times bigger in terms of population, has a GDP that's only five times that of Switzerland. And as with Switzerland, most of it comes from the banking sector. While Cameron can currently protect The City from stricter banking regulations within the EU, that option wil evaporate once the UK leaves the EU. There will be no more leverage. Britan's banking industry will be made to comply witht the much stricter banking laws that are undoubtely being passed without the restistance of the British government.	0	train

1859	Immigration or the EU are not the UK's actual problems. Like in most part of Europe, the UK is experiencing a wave of populism that has one major cause: neoliberalism. Neoliberal ideology has failed to deliver economic results because it is based on the false dogma of the self-regulating market. Since the market is supposed to regulate itself and the government can only save money and grant tax breaks to the rich (which is also a form of state intervention and another proof that self-regulating market never existed and never will exist), competition between parties in terms of different economic polices doesn't exist, hence the crisis of democracy. Moreover, the middle class has been declining and feels hopeless, but because they have been brainwashed into believing that the state can do nothing and poverty is people's own fault, they need to find a scapegoat. Immigrants and the EU are the perfect scapegoat, they are actually the main hope of neoliberal lobbies and ideologues to retain their power and influence.	0	train

1861	I don't understand why immigration has become so wrapped up in racism, it seems logical to me that there should be some controls for practical reasons.

1862	Have a look at the Sky News Website. Go to the comments under an immigration news story and have a look at them.

1952	"The complexity of this issue- who benefits, who loses from mass immigration into the UK- is almost never rationally and dispassionately debated. We are up against human nature. Having made up our minds-largely based upon emotion- we look for evidence to support our view. And we dismiss evidence that points the other way. As posts here indicate we are all of us always ""patrolling the boundaries of the normal"" (a phrase that I read somewhere that fits) and looking to exclude someone from our good graces. This issue touches on people's deepest instincts and upon their sense of their identify and for many (righty or wrongly) it's felt as an attack upon their ability to earn a wage. My instinct is that immigration brings a net benefit- in a variety of ways- but I recognise that there are costs, too. And as a salaried and housed middle class man I don't pay those costs. Both sides in this argument must desist from name-calling and look to debate the evidence rationally"	0	train

1978	basically times are hard and when they are people look to blame others. the people they should be blaming are the ones who are in charge. the ones that said give up your rights to us and the corporations because of trickle down economics. Basically we will make it easier to sack people therefore companies will be more likely to hire, but that didn't happen, all that happened was it was made easier for people to be sacked. did the wealth trickle down as promised? no of course not, that will never happen. People with money and power above all else desire...more money and power. this was a lie from the start and here we are blaming immigrants for the lies and falsehoods perpetuated by the elite, rich ruling classes. its not the fault of immigrants that there are no jobs. The jobs these people are taking are the ones British people simply don't want. Perfect example, I have a friend who wont take work because it is not what he wants to do, despite the fact its more money than benefits. I have a girl who has a chemistry degree who is from Nigeria who comes to clean my apartment. she is here working her socks off through a cleaning agency to pay for her degree.

1992	My parents were Anglo Indians who came here in the fifties a few years after Indian Independence ....they thought the terraced houses of the East End were warehouses or factories as they passed them on the train. But they made a life here. My concern is the large number of single young males gathered in France rushing moving vehicles. Their expectations of UK are unrealistic l should imagine.

2031	If we're going to go on about foreigners, especially ones from Europe, then why not start with the upper class hypocrites who live off the state? The Queen is married to a Greek asylum seeker. The Tories and UKIP aren't against immigration. The main reason the Tories voted against a minimum wage was so they can exploit cheap foreign labour from third world countries. They're only against the EU because it has rights for workers such as enough breaks. The Tories and UKIP don't care about Britain and British people. They sold off nearly everything public owned in the 80s to the highest bidders. Then by the early 90s and after much tax that affects the poor the most such as constant VAT increases, and being the first to add tax to household bills, said they were too broke to put any money into what services were left, making then the worst in Europe.	0	train

2038	Over the past years the UK had colonised half the planet with many former British colonies. The Brits have gone to war during both Word Wars in 20th century and Britain has flourished in the past due to people emigrating the UK and now the Tories and the UKIP Party complain about immigration because the Tories like the UKIP believe that migration is ruining the UK when in fact it has been proved that immigration boosts the country's economy. So if the UK leaves the EU, the Brits will loose the rights to travel freely and work in the EU and their other human rights since the UK are now part of the EU.	0	train
2039	We are a global market now with the internet and cannot escape this fact. People decrying the EU forget that years back everything had 'customs charges' as in items to/from the USA. If I buy an item from the US I get a handling charge to check for customs duty even if a few pounds is added. There is no redress as the 'appeal' is done by the people levying the charge so learnt 'Never buy from the USA' unless mega cheap . If we leave the EU this will return. We are an island so many goods are sent in with varying price differentials to mainland Europe and America. Prices will rise, property will drop about a third we will face the coming problems from global warming ourselves and the fact much of our fuel is coming from Russia and other countries. Grow up look at the size and position of our country and think if we are alone how do we survive we are not Switzerland in the middle of the land mass. Stop living thinking the world is pink on an Atlas and face reality we are a small island with many many fewer problems than some countries be grateful for what we have and work with reality...

They kept the refugees in camps for years, but refugees were okay with that, because their lives were in actual danger. No one rioted because he wanted to go to ""Germoney"". Hungarians accepted the country they were sent into, and knew that they have no right to choose where to go. Hungarians quickly blended in to Western societies, because their cultural and religious norms are very similar. And so on.

If they have nothing to hide, why dont they register themselves? Because they are not the real refugees? And if they are the real refugees, why do they fight against those who give them place, food, medical aids, trying to get into Hungaria anyway? They are acting like regardless people. It's way different from the example about 1956 you gave us man. Hungarian refugees followed the rules of the countries they were sent. It's now 2015 and people gotta obey the laws of which country where they stay. So in Hungary, refugees gotta register first before entering the land. That's the law, and that's all for the safety.

Far too many, too quickly, etc. And despite 'being persecuted and tortures' etc seem to have the energy to riot. Never mind all those men leaving behind their wives and children behind. Do people need to wait until these refugees declare Europe an Islamic state or can we now agree that refugees must be processed and must have papers. Of course as decent humans we want to help the unfortunate but when they literally invade in droves and we don't have resources to deal with it, we need to think of our own well-being. That is not racist not egocentric. It is survival, and we residents have just as many rights to survive as any immigrant or refugee. let me laugh, 1200 only and Croatia is already overwhelmed. That may be 10% of migrants arrived to Hungary. But ""mean"" Hungary should let them all in of course. The Croatian Government have invited the immigrants / refugees, like the German Government did to show humanity and „compassion” and after only a single day, Croatia has thrown in the towel and said to the immigrants Go back to Hungary because it's closer and they stuck the immigrants / refugees in buses and trains and they sent back over ten thousand people back to the Hungarian border. This means hypocrisy and complicity with immigrant traffickers from all Balkan governments from the region.

2287	"Here are some thoughts from the Croatian perspective regarding the ongoing migration situation. In short and simple words, the problem derives from the following assumptions: 1. Migrants are fleeing from the ISIS and middle east conflicts; 2. They entered the EU in Greece without being checked; 3. They were invited by Ms Merkel, as at the time Germany saw a chance to seek cheep labor force; 4. Hungary erects walls. The law says that the refugees should be registered in the country they enter first. This is neither Croatia nor Hungary. It is Greece or Turkey. Were they registered in Greece? No! They either stayed in Turkey (circa 1.8 Mil) or moved forward to Europe. There is nowhere in the EU or international law stated that borders should be protected by walls and fences? And yet, Hungary is building like crazy. Number of refugees heading for Germany exceeds German needs, so it is possible that they will no longer be welcomed in Germany. This means that they will stuck in Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia or Serbia, waiting to be properly registered and transported to other countries (e.g. USA and Canada offered no more than 130.000 places). At this point it is clear that all countries en route to Germany are not conforming with the international law requirements. The only way for Croatia to deal with the situation is by simply transferring them as soon as possible to the end destination. Unlike Hungary, Croatia does that humane. Well done Mr Milanovic. Last and most important - this migration problem cannot be handled by one country by itself. The problem needs to be resolved politically within the NATO, with the clear call for the full scale military action against ISIS. With the emphasis on ""full scale"" and ""military"". Bottom line is - all countries must cooperate and stop blaming each other or the US. We all have the same problem; we need to assemble and start taking actions against ISIS and terrorism."	0	train

Virtually no one in the world from a Non-muslim country....wants to go and live in a Muslim Cult country because of their Orwellian ""values"". The reasons are obvious. Even though they cannot openly and Consciously admit it....living within a country where everybody is literally Brainwashed from birth into a Cult, only leads to the lowest Standards of: Freedom of Thought/Expression/Sexuality/Choice, Civil and Human Rights, Education, and the lowest Standards of Living. That is life in a Muslim country. And that is why Muslims worldwide are Sub-consciously and Consciously desperate to live in Non-muslim countries. The reverse will never be true. And the more Brainwashed a Cult-member is to constantly deceive themselves..the more they will have to Deny what is staring them in the face about the sad truth of their Cult.]"	1	train

The difference is that those in the past cooperated and knew that they have obligations as refugees towards the country they seek asylum in. Yes, refugees do have obligations not rights only. We had refugees camps which are now closed as they are not used as most of them just want to go to Germany. What do you suggest we do now? Force them to register?

2317	US war against Europe, 4 steps //// The USA is at war against EU. The current wave of forced migration has been promoted and funded by US intelligence. The war against EU has had at least 4 steps: a) financial crisis 2008 (generated in US but with huge impact on EU economy) b) arab spring (promotion of wars in EU neighborhood and generation of chaos in EU borders) c) maidan and new cold war against Russia (breaking any possible partnership between EU and the Russian Federation) d) massive exodus of migrants, only 20% of them real refugees and some of them members of ISIS and other US funded jihadist organizations. When you analyze the pictures of dead babies you may arrive to the conclusion that there is something rotten in all the massive exodus (funded and organized by US intelligence services) coming to Europe using the strange route Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary (three countries hostile to US foreign policy and that still are doing business with the Russian Federation). http://www.voltairenet.org/article187588.html	1	train

Angela Merkel by saying germany will accept eveybody who will come, even unregistered, without discussing this with neighbouring countries and fellow europeans, broke all possible rules and laws that are here in Europe regarding asylum seekers process and putting so much pressure on other countries who could not be prepared. What now? I do not like the media shaming Hungary to be honest with you, I do not like any form of violence, but hey, they are really just trying to follow the rules and laws in place and very much respect Austria as they did not want just to allow the people to invade their neighbours. Then they gave up. But now Germany closes borders? Seriously?! Asylum seekers process applies for all from all around the world, but not for people from middle east or what?!	1	train
2325	As has been pointed out by MANY. These are mostly able bodied men. Refugees stop at the first point of safety... Meaning Turkey or Greece. Refugees do not throw food or rocks at citizens, dump water, and riot screaming Allahu Akbar and Osama is great. Refugees take what is offered to them until proper accommodations can be made for them. They do not demand ANYTHING because they are guests in another country. I did not want to believe it before but the more I see, I see this as an invasion. ISIS promised to reformation of the Caliphate. In their interpretation this includes all lands EVER held under Muslim dominion. Does anyone know their history? The last time Muslims ran across Europe in these numbers ended with the Ottoman Empire laying siege to Vienna 1683 September 11-12. ISIS interpretation of the Caliphate includes Spain, Sicily, and Europe the whole way to Vienna. Why are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and U.A.E. not taking these people in. They have more money than Europe and more jobs available. This has little to do with being Muslim this has to do with a mentality of being owed something. These people should have overthrown the Assad father and son instead of rallying for the downfall of the West for the last 50 years. Funny how people who HATED the west a few years ago are now whining that the wast is not doing enough.	1	train

2353	I tried to get some statistics on migrants in UK but could not.

After 3 years 87% of Syrians are still unemployed. More than half of all non-western immigrants are on welfare. Somalis have an unemployment rate of over 80%. I think this may point to just how grateful these people are to the country's taking them in and what a great contribution they make to the host countries. Do we really want more of this.	1	train

Firstly, you should acknowledge the tremendous sacrifice Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey have made, despite being far less wealthy than Europe or the oil-rich Gulf countries. Secondly, if you are going to criticize Saudi Arabia and Co, you should also have the intellectual honesty to then also slam the only other democracy in the region as well, namely Israel. Israel has taken in exactly ZERO refugees from any country, including non-Muslim black Africans. These people have been called a ""cancer"" and horded into a literal concentration camp in the middle of the Negev desert. Where is your outrage? Third, you should all realize that you are MORONS. Seriously? Let me get this straight: you expect people who are fleeing an extremist, fundamentalist version of Islam to go to Saudi Arabia, a country where people are beheaded in public places according to - SHARIA LAW? Where women are forced to dress like ninjas and treated like virtual property Seriously?!? Forth, many refugees are not Sunni Muslims or even just Muslims in general for that matter. The Gulf States on the other hand are ruled by Sunnis, some having Shia minorities. And finally, some Syrians are in fact moving to Saudi Arabia in secret, provided they have plenty of money (I know this for a fact)."	1	train

Possibly fleeing a war zone and possibly just trying to get to a better country for their own interests.

2416	Just as I said, bigoted and xenophobic, I am well read, have a degree and read all I can about everything - except The Sun and The Daily Mail. Illegal immigrants are a problem, I agree, but refugees are not, we have a duty to assist asylum seekers, who would rather be in their own country and are fleeing war and oppression. Does anyone know how many actual terrorists cross our borders every day, by plane, ship, tunnel? I guess that MI5 have some idea. My 'box' encompasses the whole of mankind, how small is yours? You need to read The Declaration on Human Rights https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCEQFjAAahUKEwimorqWjYPIAhUEXBoKHZwFAbc&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.liberty-human-rights.org.uk%2Fhuman-rights%2Fasylum-and-borders%2Fright-seek-asylum&usg=AFQjCNEni2GSK7rijzIS6-T0dUpA3PyIGA&sig2=MIc37s2auqVg7q3nq9lNxg it protects you too.	1	train

2422	Eszter, this is exactly the problem. Read my post carefully. The migrants entered the EU in Greece. Where they registered? No. Can they enter Germany? No. Orban is setting up walls.

2428	Why is BBC not calling these people for what they are?

2641	Food for Thought: One of my own misunderstandings, due to the structure of our society, was that we as followers of Christ should punish those who harm us. If the Church suffered apostacy early in the middle ages, then, it just may be that the early Christians followed Christ’s teachings even to the point of not pursuing civil punishment of those who harmed them. Christ’s teaching was “to turn the other cheek”, and forgive those who persecute you. We follow the tradition of Roman law because the traditional power structures of western civilization emerged from the Roman society. One of the keys to understanding how to have Christ’s power in your life may be to accept the actions of others without attempting to use civil government to punish the offender, which is accepted by scholars as a system of human justice implemented to prevent individuals from seeking revenge independently. Remember, Christ said, “judge not, that ye be not judged, I shall repay saith the Lord of Hosts.” No person will find it easy to ignore those who purposefully take advantage of them, but those who choose to emulate Christ, by caring for others, avoiding greed and materialism, and refusing to harm others may actually be able to call on Christ aid in time of need; this would be helpful when facing climate change.	0	train

UK declared will take in refugees from the camps in Syria where they have been already checked up by United Nations Refugee Agency. So, I believe Germany owes an apology to the other EU member countries for irresponsibly encouraging undocumented individuals to ‘’assault’’ Europe. You know the saying ‘’Charity starts at home’’ is still true. The responsible way to help the ones in need starts at home. First take care of your needy, then go to the refugee camps and select those who deserve, who really suffered and get them on planes straight to Germany by the hundred of thousands if that’s what you want.. That way the chaos and tensions that we have seen for the past several weeks between the migratory young males that are invading Europe and the locals could have been prevented.	1	train

3191	I find it extremely amusing that most individuals decreeing and demanding that Western Europe stops accepting migrants are people and countries in Eastern Europe. Basically people who are still in the dark ages, are still very much racist and well unwelcoming. I also suspect it is largely to do with the fact that they also come here to claim housing and welfare. FYI refugees in the UK and most Western European states are not entitled to any benefits. They receive a nominal amount of 15 to 20 pounds everyweek in vouchers and are given accommodation in a hostel. So seriously get off your high horse and before you preach hate look in the mirror. Read and get informed on the refugee laws... also check the statistics on the amount of EE workers who come here claim housing, benefits and work minimum wage jobs or alternatively work for cash in hand to avoid Tax payment. Those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.... also an immigrant or refugee who has qualifications and studied his/her butt off aren't stealing your jobs if all you have is a gcse and want to get out of bed at midday..... Also remember WWII this is where we will be heading if you don't curb and limit this horrid mentality and way of thinking... no one is saying open the boarders... one is suggesting vetting and to stop dehumanising fellow humans simply because of their background, ethnicity or religious beliefs. SHAME!!!	1	train
3192	Tihomir, you are indeed correct. As the picture is beginning to clear, the vast majority of the immigrants are not from war torn Syria. While I would accept the genuine refugees, i.e. the persecuted Christians. The world of Islam should look after its own, from the Atlantic coast of Morocco to the Indonesian Archipelago. Moreover, very few are genuine refugees; even under the outdated conventions, as they have already passed through a number of safe havens e.g. Turkey.	1	train

3202	@Habab Mohd. One in four babies born in London last year, had parents that were not UK nationals. This, in itself, represents the receipt of benefits, and with all of what goes with that for the future, schooling etc, it represents a great deal of resources. It is not being bigoted to recognise the facts. It is being bigoted, though, to suggest it is bigoted, just because they are facts you may dispute, or they just don't suit you.	0	train
3203	Deliberately ignoring refugees to allow spread of Islam in West: Saudi official ‘We’re letting them go to Europe, isn’t that enough?’ “We are ignoring the issue as a strategic maneuver. If these refugees go and settle in the west then they will take the beacon of light i.e. Islam, with them,” an official from the Saudi government said. “What we are doing is waiting for them to set up camp so that they can show these infidel nations how to save themselves from kufr,” he said. The current plan seems to be to let the refugees find homes in Europe and then wait to see what happens. “We already have a lot of Muslims here… we don’t need any more. We could give those white people some refuge if they wanted though,” the official said and laughed. Syrians have an exceptionally hard time migrating to Arab countries and are often denied entrance to begin with. “Look let us be honest it’s like asking a Muslim man to let a Hindu into their homes. We’re letting them go to Europe, isn’t that enough?” the official asked. “Even if we did let them in where would they live? It’s all sand here. At least they’ve got water where they are right now,” the official said and laughed again. Akhtar Al Hassani, an activist from the USA: “Islam is meant to take over the world,” he said, and added: “The Arab world will never let the refugees in so they have to go elsewhere.” Saudi Arab has released similar statements. Some Muslim countries have decided to block apps like snapchat, candy crush saga and temple run in protest of EU migration policy. “Europe can really learn a thing or two from the hijrat-e-Madina,” Hassani said of the crisis. Meanwhile, the reaction from Saudi Arabia has been lauded by many Muslim countries as being highly appropriate and on point. “We can’t take any refugees because… errr we have this thing going on,” a statement from the country said. “We are working on ensuring we don’t create too many refugees out of the Yemen war. Is that not enough?” the statement questioned in closing. It remains to be seen whether this outrage from the Muslim Ummah will result in building the kind of pressure that is needed to help resolve the refugee issue. Imam, Al-Aqsa Mosque, Jerusalem: “Europe has become old and decrepit and needs human reinforcement….they are not motivated by compassion for the Levant, its people and its refugees,” said Ayed, adding, “Soon, we will trample them underfoot, Allah willing.” “Throughout Europe, all the hearts are enthused with hatred toward Muslims. They wish that we were dead, but they have lost their fertility, so they look for fertility in our midst,” he added. “We will give them fertility! We will breed children with them, because we shall conquer their countries!” Ayed stated that “whether you like it or not,” Americans, Italians, Germans and the French will be forced to take the “refugees”. “We shall soon collect them in the name of the coming Caliphate. We will say to you: these are our sons. Send them, or we will send our armies to you,” concluded Ayed. Ayed correctly outlines the fact that Europe is facing demographic disaster because its citizens have stopped having children. Italy’s current birth rate of 8.4 per 1,000 people is the lowest since 1861 and the picture is much the same across the rest of Europe, where population is only increasing as a result of mass immigration. Birth rates in the west are far lower than those in the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, which is where most of the migrants are coming from. The notion of using mass migration as a form of stealth jihad is outlined in the Koran, which states, “And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah will find on the earth many locations and abundance.” “To emigrate in the cause of Allah – that is, to move to a new land in order to bring Islam there, is considered in Islam to be a highly meritorious act,” Khabaristan Times KHABARISTANTIMES.COM	1	train

3212	"Stephen Campbell ummmm Key Findings There were 698,512 live births in England and Wales in 2013, a decrease of 4.3% from 729,674 in 2012. In 2013, the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) decreased to 1.85 children per woman, from 1.94 in 2012. In 2013 the stillbirth rate fell to 4.7 per thousand total births, from 4.9 in 2012. The average age of mothers in 2013 increased to 30.0 years, compared with 29.8 years in 2012. Over a quarter (26.5%) of live births were to mothers born outside the UK; a small increase compared with 25.9% in 2012. Get all the tables for this publication in the data section of this publication . http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/birth-summary-tables--england-and-wales/2013/stb-births-in-england-and-wales-2013.html But i understand you got that information from the DailyMail article published around the same time. Furthermore, Latest figures from the ONS show there are now 521,000 Polish-born residents of the UK - up from 75,000 in 2003. It makes the Poles the biggest UK community by foreign nationality - and the second (after India) by country of birth. The figures came out as part of the comprehensive annual population survey, which (at least until the census results emerge next year) give us a real insight in the demographics of Britain. http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/may/26/foreign-born-uk-population Another source more recently and academic as well that backs up those numbers. That the highest foreign national births in the UK belong to India then Poland , followed by Pakistan and third, fourth and fifth is also occupied by EU member states. http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/migrants-uk-overview I propose to you sir based on your comnent that you are a bigot on the basis that you have an issue that apparently children being born in the UK belong to ""foreigners"" I.e. none whites so yeah it is prejudicial and has no room in our society.

3221	@Tolousain Andreu. UK, over these past four years, have provided more aid and assistance, doctors, clinics,medicines,services, food, tents etc etc etc, than the rest of Europe combined. In the world, UK has only been exceeded by USA in providing aid for the refugees in the countries surrounding Syria. The gulf states are also providing a lot of money to aid the refugees. I think they generally feel a large influx of non-gulf Arabs permanently coming to reside in their countries introduces an unnecessary risk to the future well -being of their nations. Palestinians have been denied citizenship of many of the arab countries they have lived in for fifty years. So, it is unsurprising.	0	train
3222	"Habab - you can't really criticise people for using statistics in a way you don't like, when you either don't tell the truth, or don't confirm your sources. To quote your first post ""FYI refugees in the UK and most Western European states are not entitled to any benefits. They receive a nominal amount of 15 to 20 pounds everyweek in vouchers and are given accommodation in a hostel."" Now, to quote the UNHCR... ""The majority of asylum seekers do not have the right to work in the United Kingdom and so must rely on state support. Housing is provided, but asylum seekers cannot choose where it is, and it is often ‘hard to let’ properties which Council tenants do not want to live in. Cash support is available, and is currently set at £36.95 per person, per week, which makes it £5.28 a day for food, sanitation and clothing."" http://www.unhcr.org.uk/about-us/the-uk-and-asylum.html Also, for your information, UK currently spends £726,000 a day housing refugees and asylum seekers. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11443871/Bill-for-asylum-seekers-bed-and-board-hits-726000-a-day.html Am I saying we don't have a moral responsibility to help?

These people have been called a ""cancer"" and horded into a literal concentration camp in the middle of the Negev desert. Where is your outrage? Third, you should all realize that you are morons. Seriously? -_- Let me get this straight, you expect people who are fleeing an extremist, fundamentalist version of Islam to go to Saudi Arabia, a country where people are beheaded in public places according to SHARIA LAW? Where women are forced to dress like ninjas and treated like virtual property? Seriously?!? Forth, many refugees are not Sunni Muslims or even just Muslims in general for that matter.

Europe must resist these ""migrants"" (really invaders) or else loose what it means to be European. These people won't embrace European culture, ideals, or customs. Islam (middle eastern and African style) is the single greatest threat to western civilization since the bubonic plaque. The west and Islam have waged war since the moors invaded Spain. As someone that values human life I can also testify that Islam does not recognize the right to life that is the most fundamental of human rights. America can't fight this fight alone, we need Europe to work with us if our civilization is to survive. Europe must resist the savagery that is Islam!"	1	train

This is the age of globalization, aren't we supposed to embrace the integration of cultures, instead of blindly preserving one's own customs? If the Westerners are angry that the other cultures would ""invade"" the West, be angry with yourselves first. In the past centuries, the West enforced its value into the other parts of the world by invading the other civilizations and massacring the natives, and in the course of globalization, Hollywood is doing the similar thing, but via a more ""civilized"" way. If even the invaded, enforced don't reject Western cultures, what is your place to reject the other cultures? Superiority? By the way, Christian/Catholic value is not more civilized than Islamic value at all. The ""true"" Christian/Catholic value that the Bible shows are racism and sexism.

3368	Hhhhhhh I am smiling! What a huge argument brought forward by Ty Royce Weldon. I would like to clarify a few points here. As far as refugees or refugee crisis is concerned, It is the laws of the European Union and the west that allow refugees enter into their territory. The same happens in the US. Mr. Ty Royce Weldon has criticised Islam strongly. Either he does not have complete information regarding it or media has brainwashed him strongly, because media shows him only what is seen by the eyes of the camera. In reality Islam never says you must force someone to convert to Islam, never allows a person to kill another human being, never allows to steal from another person, never allows to even enter the house of another person without his permission, etc. We need to respect the opinion of one another rather than critcise a whole religion. If we are used to the media and the media says that suicide bomber was a muslim from this so-called country, we directly believe it because seeing is believing, however the media never said that he was given a million dollars to carry out this bombing in a certain state, either european or asian, or that he was bought by ten million dollars and a ferrari or citiZenship of a specific well developed country. There are thousands of thousands of immigrants and refugees in Europe and the US who have embraced the customs and laws of these regions and who have never tried to impose anything upon a European or an American. I hope Mr. Ty and his followers in this argument would now agree with me. I am available to answer any questions you may have. I am a Writer in reality.	0	train

SIGNS OF THE MODERN DAY KHARIJITES (EXTREMISTS & TERRORISTS): (1) They will be young in age (Sahih Muslim & Bukhari); (2) They will be brainwashed (Ibid); (3) They will have thick, unkempt beards (Ibid); (4) Their faith will not pass their throats, which implies that their faith is shallow and skin-deep (Ibid); (5) They will be extremists in religious matters (Abu Ya'la & al-Razzaq); (6) They shall quote the Qur'an believing it is for them although in reality it is against them (Sahih Muslim & Bukhari, Abu Dawood, al-Tabari, al-Asqalani); (7) They will be extremely oppressive, bloodthirsty and violent (Abu Dawood); (8) They will be the most evil of the creation (Sahih Muslim); (9) They will shed blood that is inviolable-the blood of humankind/civilians (Sahih Bukhari & Muslim, al-Hakim) and; (10) They would be made the dogs of Hell [in the Hereafter] (al-Tirmidhi). ISIS or ISIL or IS or any other group that has an ideology of murdering humankind is categorically outside the fold of Islam. They have no connection with Al-Qur'an nor with the seerat [teachings] of Mustafa/Muhammad (SAW).

3402	People commenting about how he is wrong about the Qu'ran apparently never picked one up and read it... It says right in it.. Just like the bible that murdering others is a sin.

3419	The IRA did in the 70s I believe ....	0	train
3420	The IRA didn't. But youngsters where pretending to be 16 so they could go and fight for them cos it seemed exciting. One of the reasons I hate the forces. They make these amazing videos showing how exciting it is. They don't don't show real men lying with heads arms and legs blown off, they don't show the man lying in a gutter in the city because he was injured so no use to the forces any longer and has lost everything including his home. They don't show the many forces people with severe mental health issues because of the atrocities they've experienced. No they show the fun, the adventure the excitement, the promise of a career and good pay. They're just as evil. And as for this man on the video and others like him. They are not teaching Islam, they are ISIS, they are terrorists who hide behind the name of religion, hide behind Islam to carry out their evil acts. The sooner people understand and see this the sooner people will leave religion and religious people alone. A truly religious person does not harm others. Stop blaming religion and start seeing the evil for what it really is. As for the beautiful place. These children have been taken to a beautiful place in order for them to feel relaxed and happy and believe that what is being pushed into their little minds is good and okay.	0	train

3821	Rejjy Smith Corinthians 11:3-16 3 But I want you to know that the head of every man is the Christ; in turn, the head of a woman is the man; in turn, the head of the Christ is God. 4 Every man who prays or prophesies with something on his head shames his head; 5 but every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered shames her head, for it is one and the same as if she were a woman with a shaved head. 6 For if a woman does not cover herself, she should have her hair cut off; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or shaved, she should be covered. 7 For a man should not have his head covered, as he is God’s image and glory, but the woman is man’s glory. 8 For man did not come from woman, but woman came from man. 9 And what is more, man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man. 10 That is why the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels. 11 Besides, in connection with the Lord, neither is woman separate from man nor is man separate from woman. 12 For just as the woman is from the man, so also the man is through the woman; but all things are from God. 13 Judge for yourselves: Is it fitting for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 14 Does not nature itself teach you that long hair is a dishonor to a man, 15 but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her hair is given to her instead of a covering. 16 However, if anyone wants to argue in favor of some other custom, we have no other, nor do the congregations of God.	0	train

3906	I will also qualify my previous comment: it is appropriate for Christian women who are involved in outreach missions to Muslims in their own culture in the middle east to wear the hijab.

4043	This is the mentality governments and people don't understand. Muslims put their religion above everything, including laws and allegiance to country.

4390	"Nova, yes I wear an abaya. But what is the topic here, hijab or abaya? We are talking about covering of the head/hair right? Secondly, some women wear hijab not only as a form of modesty but also to show their identity. They wear it because it's what they are used to & simply because they want to. The fact they ""adorn"" their face with makeup as Mario states just proves that they wear the hijab out of choice as surely someone who is forced to wear it would not be allowed to wear makeup. The fact that Mario points that he has seen so many women with hijab and makeup just proves that hijab is not something that is forced upon Muslim women as suggested or perceived by the western world."	0	train
4392	Mahrukh I don't mind the hijab but your responses as a young woman in the KSA begs the question I asked. Personally, I find the fact you cannot go out your door without being swathed in an abaya, unable to drive yourself, and needing a male family member's permission, offensive. Just saying.	1	train

4397	Nova, what you find offensive is just the norm for the women here. What you find offensive maybe what is comfort and ease for the women here. Things were not like this in the 70s, different eras bring about different rules. I am sure in years to come there will be change once again-no one can say for sure. I have seen doctors/nurses (female) just wear the white coats-no abayas. The abaya aspect is more of conforming aspect as Scott has suggested-for the ones that take it off when abroad. There are cities that are more strict and ones that are less. There are women who wear hijab for modesty or the ones who wear it with makeup out of their own choice because their perception is what it is. It's not one strict rule. That's what I'm trying to say.	0	train

4535	PC you need to read-up on your history, most of what you post, is utter nonsense, obviously from generations of a family who despise the Conservatives. Mining, BSC, Unions, perhaps!!!! HM contributes more to this Nation, than she receives. £280m goes into the Treasury coffers, in return she receives £37m. Plus tourism, restaurants, hotels, transport, all benefit from the Sovereign. Immigration is a 'poison chalice' yes there are too many allowed into this Country, NHS, Education, Welfare, infrastructure, are all bursting at the seams. On the other hand, would the Welfare scroungers, fill the positions that they are willing to do.? The answer is quite clearly NO NO NO. This Country needs to take a tough stance on future immigrants, including those from Asia, who pose an even bigger threat. Make it an unattractive proposition. No benefits, no housing. Why do you think they are queuing-up in Calais? They are by-passing other Countries to seek refuge in this soft-touch Nation. Cameron needs to inform Merkel, to mind her own b---business.

That’s the ""EU Agenda"" in a nut shell. Lets break this right down to the bare bones and look at it in a way the people on the high streets can understand. Looking back I remember going shopping for fruit and veg to the green grocers, for meat to the butchers. and for clothes to the clothes shop, for a tv or radio we went to the electrical shop. All these retailers got their products from many different sources all negotiating the prices and selling at their own price, i used to go from shop to shop and see and brows the produces and prices. Then came the supermarkets who started off selling foods, then clothes, then electrical, then medication, then insurances, then banking... Etc, etc.... Now we have the hated controlling Tesco and such like with stores not just in our country buy around the globe. They control the prices the farmers charge, the prices the clothing manufactures charge, the prices the electrical manufactures charge and so on and in turn they control what you pay and buy and how you buy and how you pay. Using Tesco as an example of one large organisation that changed the way every one lived and shopped and took away the individuality and freedom and choice from people and controlling everyone like sheep.

4617	We need to stop letting all and sundry into the UK and stop giving immigrants benefits as soon as they arrive. I don't mind people coming to this country from other countries as long as they have the money to fund themselves over here. If we went to another country we would have to have enough money to live for at least 5 years and wouldn't get any benefits from those countries either. If we didn't have the money then we wouldn't get in it's as simple as that. ALSO we need to add boundaries like if they have a criminal record no way would they get in, if they don't have the job specifications they wouldn't get in also that they would get NO benefits whatsoever for a minimum of 5 years (like Australia) and then you would only get benefits after the 5 year point if you have been working for those 5 years and you get basic benefits at that point and the longer you have worked the more you would be entitled too. If we brought in all those stipulations I would be fine with whoever came into this country as then I would know that they are not a drain on our economy. We are too nice to other minorities in this country and forget about our own people and their needs. We need to put our own people first and the other minorities second. ALSO we need to stop giving them monies for their children that are not even in this country also!!!!! EVERY minority that comes to this country should not be entitled to any free NHS, NO money from DSS, NO free housing etc they are the ones wanting to come to this country it's not as if we are begging them to come here so they can claim benefits it is their choice and most come to this country (NOT ALL) only want to come to the UK because of everything they get when they arrive. If we stopped handing out everything to them and gave them nothing you can bet probably 80% of those that want to come over here would not then want to come to this country as they wouldn't get all the handouts then and it is the handouts that they are loving and entice them here x	1	train

4623	"As with any issue today, public attitudes regarding Immigration and the EU are being determined by a mixture of general dumbing down and a total lack of attention span. A superficial, knee-jerk prejudice is easy to communicate in the snappy soudbites that the media and twitter has accustomed us to. Responding to those ignorant and misleading messages requires background, knowledge and information and a reasoned, articulated argument. People are just too lazy to read complicated messages these days, so they are naturally attracted to simplistic slogans and soundbites that convince them that issues are simple and the solutions equally simple. There is no such thing as a simple political issue and any politician who promises a ""cure-all"" like leaving the EU is a quack, however much he/she may say the things you like to hear. Anyone who believes that an exit from the EU will resolve more problems than it will create is as self-deluded as they are manipulated. The UK is an attractive country for immigrants because it presents a successful image to the world. The reality is that the UK is no longer a Political or economic power that is strong enough to stand on its own in relation to the massive interests of the US, China or for that matter the EU. The UK, outside the EU would fast become a political irrelevance on the Internatiional scene. Absurdly, it's exactly those naiive and anachronistic flag-waving patriots fighting for 'Britishness' that are least in touch with British culture today. I'm proud to be British, but my pride is linked to our Multi-ethnic culture as a whole and not some lame royal regalia or bowler-hat and pinstripe tourist nonsense. Our Multicultural society is one the few positive consequences of our colonial past, and Britain has every reason to be proud of having achieved the enriched society it has today. Our multicultural society s a far more accurate and rich expression of our Island's historical heritage than red telephone boxes and roast beef. By all means seal yourself off from the world and watch the country slide into irrelevance and economic meltdown, but that will be a consequence the UK would be entirely responsible for and not something you can lay at the door of exploited and marginalized immigrants."	0	train

4698	"the comments which come from brains of advocates of murder in the name of ""our country"" and ""our problems"" ignore the fact that development and migration are intrinsically related, that the capitalist system inherently develops unevenly, that the British regime is part and parcel of economic policies imposed on poor countries through various means (IMF, World Bank, support of dictatorships, freedom of their corporations to plunder, etc, etc), that the same regimes have played a significant role in aborting the attempt of the same people fleeing ""their countries"" in overthrowing the oppressive system at home (see the so-called Arab Spring, the elections, the NGOs, etc) all in order to maintain the status quo. Then you wonder why people flee and drown in the sea. It's the failure of a certain capitalist modality in large swathes of the world. Capital, a thing, is free to migrate anywhere, but humans are not. so, thank you all of you, bunch of murder apologists and defenders of your own oppressive barbaric regime in Britain. instead of attacking the Regime here and its criminality against its own population you are finding a scapegoat as it is an easy target demonstrating your complicity in barbarism."	1	train

The same guy that's saying Jews, Romani and Sami people can't be Swedish.) 2. Same-sex couples and single people should only be able to adopt a kid if they're closely related to it, or if they already have a parent-child relationship with it. 3. No abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy. 4. Major strategic cuts and legislations forcing women to stay at home with their litter of kids, like income splitting.

People can think what they want, and I won't judge you for holding a certain view or belief, but we already are a secular state, meaning our politics shouldn't dictate what is right or wrong in the name of religion.

4919	Race to the bottom.. Sweden to become a Third World Country by 2030, according to UN: According to UN projections, Sweden will be a much poorer country by 2030, much worse than what anyone in the Swedish government indicates. The UN report HDI (Human Development Index) predicts a significant decrease in Swedish prosperity, unlike their Nordic neighbors, who will retain their top positions and even strengthen them globally in the long run. In 2010 Sweden had the 15th place in the HDI rankings but according to UN forecasts, Sweden will be #25 in 2015, and in 2030 on the 45th place. Sweden is one of few countries with such a sharp deterioration from what it had in 2010. Fewer ends up on welfare dependency in their Nordic neighboring countries while Sweden continues to have a greater amount of family households forced to live on welfare, which are a couple factors causing the dropped global competitiveness. Negative developments, or rather liquidations can be exemplified by Orrefors Kosta Boda, which in 1992 had 940 employees in Sweden and was a profitable industry. Today less than 100 remain in the company after further cost reductions and adaptations in order to meet global competition. Most of today's less developed countries such as Cuba, Mexico, the Baltic countries and Bulgaria according to the 2030 UN report will be passing Sweden in prosperity. Even Greece, which today is more or less bankrupt, but will be on 13th place by 2030.	0	train

4939	"Jon Eriksson: Yes. No one dismisses the statistics, it's the comparison between different countries that is misleading. The purely statistical rise in the number of rapes per 100 000 inhabitants in Sweden is partly due to legislative changes. Unlike before and other countries, we now count all separate incidents, and we have also gotten a much wider definition of rape. Besides those facts, more rape victims report the crimes than before. So. If we, like other countries, were to lump tens, hundreds or thousands of rapes together, we would indubitably have ended up further down the list. The same goes for if we, like other countries, would have a narrower definition of rape. Reality isn't what it looks like on paper – especially not in many, many other countries. Winston: Vad syftar du på? 🤔 Eric Sneed: I've spent many nights in Rosengård, but it didn't make me hate immigrants. Did I do it wrong..?

4946	"What ignorant lier said that Swedish is NOT the Rape Capital of Europe?!? Seriously , the worst thing I know is people who blatantly defend something by pure denial, without even having read the statistics! The most idiotic way for a debater who expects people to respect their opinions is to NOT make any research, but instead making claims based on their own beliefs that "" No, this is too horrible for me to accept, and therefore I will NOT in any way even consider that this is true. Just like a child that denies that he came into existing by his parents having sexual intercourse, because his parents would never do such a thing!!"" Sadly though, if you just Google ""country with highest rapes"" the top page you'll see is Wikipedia: Rape Statistics - and here is an excerpt from that page : - In Australia the reported rape rate per 100,000 people is relatively high, although it is in a decreasing trend, coming down from 91.6 in the year 2003 [28] to 28.6 in 2010.[29] This stands in contrast to reported rape rate of 1.2 per 100,000 in Japan, 1.8 per 100,000 in India, 4.6 rapes per 100,000 in Bahrain, 12.3 per 100,000 in Mexico, 24.1 per 100,000 in United Kingdom, 28.6 per 100,000 in United States, 66.5 per 100,000 in Sweden, and world's highest rate of 114.9 rapes per 100,000 in South Africa.[28][29] - This sadly making Sweden the number one rape country in Europe, only to be surpassed by South Africa. But it shocks me that not more women are fighting against the fact that Sweden has the SECOND highest rate of rape IN THE FUCKING WORLD!!! I mean, with all these feminist movements and political groups we have in Sweden not ONE actually addresses the most hideous crime that a woman can ever be subjected to?! What the hell is wrong with people??? Stand up for your sisters in your own country instead of denying the facts and instead protecting the thousands of men that thrive on this rape culture...

I'll humour you with a few excerpts from the Wikipedia page to which you're referring: ""However, widely differing legal systems, offence definitions, terminological variations, recording practices and statistical conventions makes any cross-national comparison on rape statistics difficult, which is why the UNODC itself caution against using their figures."" ""The Swedish police record each instance of sexual violence in every case separately, leading to an inflated number of cases compared to other countries. Sweden also has a comparatively wide definition of rape. This means that more sexual crimes are registered as rape than in most other countries. For example, in 2005 Sweden reformed its sex crime legislation and made the legal definition of rape much wider, which led to a marked increase in reports."" ""Additionally, the Swedish police have improved the handling of rape cases, in an effort to decrease the number of unreported cases."" ""According to the FRA study there's a strong correlation between higher levels of gender equality and disclosure of sexual violence. This, and a greater willingness among Swedish women to report rape in relationships, may also explain the relatively high rates of reported rape in Sweden, which has a long-standing tradition of gender equality policy and legislation, as well as an established women's movement, and has been ranked as the number one country in sex equality."" tl;dr: Learn a little about data interpretation, don't reach conclusions based purely on assumptions, and always, always read texts/Wikipedia pages (at least the parts related to the subject of discussion) in their entirety; especially if you're using them as references to back up your claims."	0	train

No registration, no benefits. × ID checking along the Swedish boarders and on Öresundsbron. I'D checks before boarding ships from Germany and Denmark. NO ID, NO asylum for refugess.

5020	Lorenzzo, Do you live in Sweden? My experience of Romanians, who you and your other countryman describe as criminals and uncivilised, isn't at all anything of what you are describing. Sure they beg and probably pickpocket a phone or wallet here and there but just like any country, civilised or not, crime does exist. What makes your statement so sad is that you believe that it's restricted in some way to Romanians only. Swedish natives create enough crime on their own, with or with out any help from immigrants. The problem in Sweden is that SD have managed to spread the word, to enough voters, to convince them that it's because of immigration, religion and anyone who looks different then the normal Sweed. This is a movement that is wrecking and embarrassing a beautiful country - that other countries all over the world looked at as a stabil, united and proud country. I am a proud Eritrean Catholic Woman, I was born and raised in Sweden. I went to school and then started working straight after in IT, my family embrace the Swedish culture, celebrated their traditions as their own. Throughout my whole life in Sweden, I never feared to be hated because of the colour of my skin. It makes me sad to say that this is no longer my reality.. I am afraid. So, shame on you for supporting such a crule party, that is working so hard to destroy my home. You are helping them to create a divided society by spreading hate and fear for the unknown.	0	train

In reality, a country has a right to protect its culture and to limit its intake of immigrants.

They try to fill peoples hearts with fear and anger. Unfortunately they have managed to do it among males (mostly) who are uneducated, many of them out of work... They talk about Sweden as a country it has never been: all people thinking the same, all people liking the same things, all people wanting the same things... Sweden is one of the richest countries. Of course the immigrants will cost a lot og money in the beginning. But we need to be more inhabitants since we have a low nativity. My biggest fear is not the refugees that come here. My biggest fear is the neonazists in SD and their followers. They are the ones that spreads hate, anger, fear and who act out this in many ways.

The vast migration has triggered the swedish people to put their vote on them, but they have been around long before any immigrants coloured our white suburbs. As a swede who grew up with Palme and social equality, heartfelt solidarity and an unprecedented welfare-system, I am in agony and actually planning for future underground resistance or me leaving Sweden. I am not alone, most swedes are as concerned as me, but political uncertainty still makes SD the largest party among a lot of semi-big ones. There is no way that the Sweden Democrats (i.e. the nazi security service, SD) can lead the country or lead to anything else than surpluse lessons that Sweden never got to learn in WW2. Our country is just a couple of years away (elections are in 2018 and SD is now the largest party in polls, making them eager for a fast re-election and a fast take-over) from being hijacked by a malevolent ""party"" with a bloodline straight from the SS highquarters (evidence based, please check it out) in Berlin 1942. Check the sources and you will find it is for real. Sounds like sci-fi but sadly is not. In the 90's there was a political movement among the neo nazis that collected them with fascist forces. Street violence drastically fell and people experienced an eerie silence, going from neo nazis murdering and battering of those in opposition: homosexuals, immigrants, ""lefties"" etc, to an appreciated parliamentary movement. The SD, formed by old nazis in 1988, left the uniforms and sieg heils behind them and organized themselves in a ""political"" party, SD. Today, their accomplishments are uniting and focusing racist, fascist and nazi groups, spreading propaganda that supports and leads to racist murderings and arson. This will soon be everyone's problem, no matter nationality. So please – UN, GB, US – anyone. Help. Make sure that the World community does not accept a regime that stands against civil rights, free speech and democracy. Do not allow the worst parts of our history to repeat itself.

5198	I lived in Sweden for 12 years. Wonderful place. Heja Sverige....! I left Sweden for the UK just as the SD were growing in momentum. Back then they were met with great disapproval - and disbelief - by fellow Swedes. I have sadly, yet almost understandably witnessed their growth in popularity. The problem seems to be twofold- lacklustre Swedish immigration / integration policies and a stubborn mentality towards a multicultural society (although this is still via a minority, thankfully) I recall moving to Stockholm in 1998, where you never saw the homeless on the streets, these days you can't walk more than four blocks with running into panhandlers... Who in many cases seem to be connected to foreign organised crime rings. What are the authorities doing about this? Nothing or very little, it seems... hence one can fathom the discontent. Not that the example above warrants racism, or even imply that SD are all racists (and yes, I would love to see the chap in the video being locked in a room full of Romanians and have him explain filthiness in greater detail...)	1	train

We even had commercials on the subway about the romainens who begs and how they make Sweden filthy with their presence.

They are using our own values and laws against us.

Parties that are in opposition almost always go up in the polls because of disappointment with the ruling government. Of course people are disappointed today but that doesn't mean they sympathize with right wing extremists.	0	train
5275	As a Swede myself, these people in SD, whether it's in their youth wing or traditional party, they have low intellectuality and are people that mostly are previously bullied in their life and now filled with hatred. I can guarantee everyone of you that they neither have seen much in their life nor want to educate theirselves upon different diversities in life. Deep down, they are just scared individuals and I feel sorry for them. We should help them understand the fundamental problems instead of letting them create problems which are no problems in the first place. Most of these hypocrites comes from rich families and have a pattern of similar xenophobic tendencies.	1	train

How many Syrians have you taken in? How many bombs have you dropped? I certainly agree that some of what SD representatives come out with is atrocious and racist; but the core issue that the party represents is one that shouldn't be - yet is - overlooked. When mainstream parties refuse to listen to their electorate, opting instead to classify their opinions as markers of fascism, the result is a surge in the popularity of fringe parties. If our government - or indeed parties in the opposition, such as the Moderates - had actually taken this issue seriously, we wouldn't be in a position where the latest poll shows that SD is now Sweden's biggest party. But they don't listen, and they pride themselves on ensuring that Sweden is seen as the best, most open and tolerant country, instead of actually ensuring that we can look after the people to whom we give asylum. The result is that we take in far too many asylum seekers who have no option but to live in tents in the freezing cold. That's not humane, and it's not democratic."	1	train

Getting away from that issue, it's pretty funny how you use the youth association of SD(SDU) as examples of showing how immature SD's members are. Since they are youth they are naturally more immature, but from experience, truth is they don't mature any farther than that so it's quite the fitting picture.

5361	National identity is a concept that once served more or less to make peace within rival regions- and was in a way useful back then. But the way it's used now is to shut people out and create a false sense of identity between people who don't necessarily have anything in common. That is what's happening with SD- they claim that Swedes are homogenous and that we automatically share ''identity'' or ''culture'' which doesn't say shit- but is a tidier version to present of Hitler's idea of the white ''race''. Once again, to make myself extremely clear: national identity is a concept, a construct and it isn't real!! Nor is the Swedish culture- as culture is something that is endlessly influenced and interpreted by all kinds of people. Culture is dynamic and ever changing. It is impossible to say that there is one, true way to practice. But most importantly- it is NOT under threat. How could it be, as it is up to you to practice it yourself??

How come more and more people is listening in UK to Nigel Farage., especially mostly Jew Is it because UKIP is a Nazi-party in UK? NO!

Also people may start knowing a little bit more about the real world other than the cultures they enjoy and live in as time/money, materialism, christmas, easter ect. What every human should know about is Shamanism, DMT, Ayahuasca, Psilcoybin, Religion, Christian gnostic. Conciousness. For me its very obvious that humans became humans by eating psilocybin mushrooms. Mushrooms are the largest organism on earth and has been here for over 500 million years, so life could have been seeded on this planet by mushrooms spores. The psychedelic experience is the origin of all religion, meditation is techniches without any ""tools"". Before Christ there was the Elusian mysteries.

5384	Mass immigration doesn't work. It's too much for the northern countries. The problem is finance, crime, the massive amount of immigrants, and the lack of finance. The latter leads to a lack of integration. Malmö has gone to shit and they have to do something from political point of veiw. Too bad the guardian only shows half the picture. And by the way, multiculture doesn't work. It doesn't work in Denmark, Norway or Sweden. The problem is the word racist. I don't want to send the immigrants back to a miserable life, but right now the immigrants are sleeping in tents in northern Norway where the temperature can widdle down to -30° We simply dont have the resources :(	0	train

5388	Lars Rebbestad i work in Norway my friend, so i can argue a bit about Norwegian resources and space. It's not a matter of resources or space. It's a matter of acceptance. With all love to my beloved Norwegians but it's the time for Europe to stand on itself and stop wars and prevent it from happening instead of being puppets to the US . EUROPEANs should just forget their colonial history and start acting as responsibles. I'm aware that Norway is not part of EU but I'm arguing about the general situation in EU.	0	train
5389	You also have to remember Kotaiba, we are living on oil money. Oil money that will run out. People seem to forget that we don't have a viable backup plan if our funds get depleted. We are supposed to save up money so we can live a few years after the oil runs out. Maybe even find a plan B backed up by that fund. We are not directly part of the EU, but we signed a deal so we could get imported food easier. That signing includes giving money to countries like Greece and Spain. Sure we have money now, but if we spend it all on the refugees (which also costs money because of welfare, housing and food) then we are basically ruining our future. And now with the oil pricing dropping... Norway might be one of the richest countries in the world but we are saving our money untill the time comes when we don't have oil. Note: I said big cities don't have space, and i live in a pretty remote and small area. The immigrants and refugees who live here are complaining about it being too remote :(	0	train
5390	I would argue here that refugees are refusing their given remote houses for one reason, they want to work and not to live on well-fare system. Therefore they believe living in a remote house would not help them to find a work where they can be independent. I can say that clearly as I work closely with refugees. as you see, those guys want to give to the country not to take. You argue that those refugees are handicaps who will live on Norway funds for good and that is absolutely wrong.

Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. if you have the most extreme refugee policy in the western world some people will obviously react in an extreme way. This extreme reaction in turn creates another extreme reaction (AFA, RF, etc) so basically our government has created nothing but chaos. But i guess it's alright, as long as we don't appear racist. all the money that has went to refugees could've been used to help people in refugee camps very efficiently. But i guess swedes aren't satisfied with merely knowing that they helped, they need others too know aswell. And don't deny that, we have all seen plenty of posts on facebook how someone donated 100Kr to the red cross or something similar. what makes Sweden great is that it handles most things in moderation, balancing alot of aspects of society almost perfectly. The current migration policy is about as balanced as Steven Seagals diet. To summarize, you are either vain or ignorant, or both. Fuck you all.	1	train

The situation with the refugees is a problem for the authorities because they're under a lot of stress and are under financed, meaning a lot of pro bono work (by the lefts, not right mind you) has been essential to keep roofs over their heads.

5424	but let's be realistic.. Sweden is already ruined because it moved from nanny state socialism into sudden competitive and money draining EU, at about the same time as it ran out of funds built up since WW2 from selling arms to both sides.. and while it's on its knees suddenly it gets shed loads of immigrants. This has nothing to do with racism:- it just doesn't work economically, no matter how one massages the statistics. And why are people 'refugees' traversing peaceful lands to get here? At that point they are no longer refugees, if they ever were, but economic migrants. There's more to it than that but that's the nutshell version.	1	train

5486	"Very one sided piece indeed. But like everything in life, there are two sides to a story. The arson at asylum facilities and the repulsive quote that drew all the clicks (let's face it) are appalling indeed. But this sort of social convulsion is hardly surprising during such a refugee crisis coupled with large scale terrorism. These are times when the bad guys got inside Europe together with the good ones who genuinely needed help. Everyone is scared and it's only natural that most people will turn against mass immigration under these circumstances. There are other factors such as the loss of identity a country goes through - a country with reduced population at that, which would see its ethnic composition warped, and the economic impact it would have. But for the most part, these people are worried about their country - a free, liberal, modern country with freedom of expression having its identity warped by the ascension of radical, intolerant forms of religion, by people who refuse to integrate and embrace another culture. This is maybe the biggest worry. It struck me how naive the reporter sounded (or maybe she has precognitive powers) when she said ""it has worked in countries like the UK"". Well, has it?

Rubel has fallen so low and the economic crisis made Russia desperate. So when he started bombing in Syria he bombed anti Assad forces in the name of ISIS. Still his major bombing is against them. But after the aircraft was bombed he is bombing some parts of Raqqua but that's not his main target. Putin is trying to install confidence in Russians. It's pure politics.	0	train

5502	One can easily understand why people feel that there are problems in Sweden, because - there are, people are afraid and Sweden is taking in too many people, but what can you do? Abandon your humanity and leave people to suffer and eventually die? To lead a country is difficult, it's a tough balance between doing the right thing as a human being whilst trying to do what's best for the future of the country. I'm not pro SD, rather the opposite, I understand why it has become like this though, it is because we pour in people into the country, and well yes some swedish people are stupid. There's an issue here, a BIG one - this video is stupid, it should consider the rest of the countries that do not accept as many immigrants, they're the real anti-humanitarians. Cause and effect... If you don't take in any people, of course people don't make a racist-party full of morons. Sweden need a big change in politics, but there are no reasonable parties up for election regarding this matter - therefore, people that are misguided and afraid also choose to vote for this party. If there was something in between things would look a lot different - other parties are too afraid to look into these questions whilst SD does - that said, it's a necessary evil having this party right now, so that the other understand the need of the people.	1	train

They are not like the United States, Canada and other American continent countries (countries of immigrants that they stole from the original American Indians). Nor they are like the current or older colonists like U.K, France and etc. that have the responsibility to take in immigrants in from all those countries they previously colonized or those countries they have destroyed in middle east and Africa during their past or recent invasions and occupations that have left those countries ruined and their people running away as immigrants and refugees all over the world... Old countries and nations like Sweden, Norway , Finland, Hungry and etc. don't have to pay the ultimate price of getting their own respective countries ruined by immigrants that have no desire to assimilate into their cultures and people due to so many different reasons... These countries have every right to preserve their true national identities and way of life without being called racists and being condemned for it by immigrants and others in other countries. At the same time, they have to change their immigration laws accordingly and treat those immigrants they already let in with dignity and according to the rules of law!	1	train

The UN 1951 Refugee Convention is based on the declaration of human rights, which states that all individuals have the right to seek asylum from persecution in other countries. So basically, yes, it is a question of morality: these people are fleeing war and death. We are not being ""nice"" to them, we are being humane. Like all many Europeans, I also somehow fear that we might let terrorists posing our refugees within our borders, but I also think that racist and xenophobic actions in our society will only do harm and radicalise people.

Also during the annexation, we treat Koreans the same. No one was forced by the Japanese government and we have a lot of official documents and newspaper articles proving the point. Comfort women, the majority of them were Japanese and there were Korean ones but they were paid more than high ranked soldiers. With that they could build 20 houses per year.

Immigrants are doing jobs which a lot of people don't want to take rather they are sitting unemployed or taking sickness benefits. 3.Cab and buses drivers are paying taxes and contributing their role the in country's economy not sitting at home and taking benefits. 4. Educated immigrants are playing a vital role in Hospital and pharmaceutical departments. 5.I.T sector is another example where immigrants are not only helping the growth of the well-renowned companies but also bringing the innovative conceptions and ideas. 6.Food and pizza- Restaurants are mostly run by immigrants bringing international cuisine and taste in the country.

Muslims slaughtering a load of young people at a concert in Paris, leaves the LIBLABCON punch drunk their revered immigrants killing people instead of been compliant and just so grateful. Sweden, once one of the most safest countries in the world, has now become the rape capital of the world, directly because of Islamic immigration.

If they prefer Sharia Law, and live the life of Muslims then we advise them to go to those places where that's the state law. Russia does not need Muslim minorities. Minorities need Russia, and we will not grant them special privileges, or try to change our laws to fit their desires, no matter how loud they yell 'discrimination'. We will not tolerate disrespect of our Russian culture. We had better learn from the suicides of America, England, Holland and France, if we are to survive as a nation. The Muslims are taking over those countries and they will not take over Russia. The Russian customs and traditions are not compatible with the lack of culture or the primitive ways of Sharia Law and Muslims.

Sweden is a broken country by now and it's because all of our money goes to helping the immigrants. They just pour in and in and in and they become seggregated from the swedish culture and society. I grew up in a very ""diverse"" neighbourhood with Swedes and middle easterns and all sorts of cultures and races living side by side and we all got along fine. Why? Because they were assimilated into society. They didn't live in their own parts of the city, they didn't live in specific areas where the state puts them because there are no homes left for these people to go to so they just sit in their asylum waiting to get a job, waiting to be sent somewhere where they can start their new life, but it never comes because there are too many of them. Sweden can't take in any more because there's no space left, people have to realize that and stop calling every anti-immigration person a racist. Stop painting SD as some sort of radical nazi party because they're not. Only the politically correct idiots of the country who have nothing but good things to say about immigration think like that, because they have no idea how economics and assimilation work, they think that we can just take in the entire middle eastern and African population with no problems at all arising.

5686	"I think these people would feel lost without their ""cause"", without the presence of foreigners who are actually sustaining their pride, their ""superiority"", their fight. they look empty-headed to me, intoxicated by FILTHY tabloid newspapers, incapable of giving any better arguments than ""we want sweden as it was before"". well, guess what, romania is also not the same anymore, and that's because you are voraciously chopping it's forests down. and that's just an example of how the rich countries are rich and the poor are poor. nobody likes leaving his or her country in search for a better place to live, and there's a lot of suffering involved in this. the world belongs to everybody, and it's such a shame that in 2015 you can still find young people, especially well educated ones, thinking in old, racist, territorial ways. unlike these poor migrants you still have your families and friends around, be thankful for that and think about better ways to deal with the migration problem!"	1	train
5687	Good for Sweden, this backlash was bound to happen after crushing their national identity and telling them that Swedes don't have a right to their own country.	0	train
5688	Swedish variation of shame and hate! They easily forget how they were immigrating to USA They easily forget how Sweden was selecting workers in countries like Greece during '50s to build up Sweden They easily forget how Swedish people were sorting jobs themselves would never take (like cleaning WCs) They easily forget Sweden is a weapon producer & they easily forget they have the responsibility for their goverments' procedures and decisions to build up getos into the Swedish cities: but as long as this was a way to keep strangers away from Sweden, this was not an issue to discuss among the elits	1	train

5690	Yusuf Jibali UKIP's counterpart.. Bunch of retards	1	train
5691	Worst thing is ukip aren't seen as racist here, but sd are in Sweden	0	train
5692	People accept SD here! Over 20% will vote for them and over 50% think they have the best migration policy! Sorry! Racist bullshit isn't working anywhere for you !	1	train
5693	Well, i guess i will support every party that is currently actively against this non-violent crusader to the West. If they want a shelter, why don't they just accept their shelter and supply at Hungary ? If they use the the cause of war in their homeland, will they leave EU once the war is over or wil they just sit there and ruin all EU nations ?	1	train
5694	I know this everybody know this that Sweden people I'm talking about who live in Sweden they so racist and just stupid, from time ago the don't like black peoples and people with blue eyes so what dose that tell you about Sweden they so so Neo-Nazi	1	train
5695	So funny because in our side of the world, democrats are usually the people supporting asylum to refugees and social reforms. And it's strange there are extremist groups in Sweden. I always thought they were extremely friendly.	0	train
5696	Sweden has let in 200 000 mostly males from the Middle East! Most without even showing a passport ! That is extreme! Rapes have sky rocketed! In proportion to the population it would be as if USA let 5-6 million in! Some of witch are part of terror organizations! They don't let in one person! You from P.rico should know how hard it is to get into the states You don't think people would get mad if there were no borders ? There are soon 107 males to every 100 women in the country! You expect women to cheer that ?	1	train
5697	No I don't because Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, which means I'm an U.S. Citizen by birth and I can live in the country legally and can fly back and forth to visit my family without a passport.	0	train
5698	Ok. I didn't know about that then! Well: see how the Mexicans get treated once they are caught! They get sent back with the first bus! Here they get money and housing as soon as they run into the country illegally!	0	train
5699	USA is discussing if they should let in 10000 Syrians! That's what runs into the country every week without passports	0	train
5700	Like anywhere in the world there are a few assholes that ruin it for others. This is a shameful representation of Sweden and I'd hope these morons and their racist and xenophobic views get crushed by common sense, tolerance, kindness, and real democracy. Whatever these SDU assholes are peddling is disgusting.	1	train
5701	No multiculturalism = no inter-ethnic violence. I don't support violence against foreign people, but I also think that immigration is its own problem. I disagree that the US and UK are successful multicultures - they are largely segregated, and they seethe below the surface. Some support immigration while others oppose, but those who oppose are pressured into silence. I've recently moved to Japan on a work assignment, and there are very few foreigners here (Japan is 98.5% ethnically Japanese, even Tokyo is only 3% foreign). Some foreigners say it's a xenophobic society, but it's also one of the safest, cleanest, most prosperous and technologically advanced places you'll find anywhere. I question whether this would be possible with large numbers of refugees or other immigrants, particularly from countries where poverty is the norm and values are dramatically different. The refugee situation in Europe would be different if there were a clear plan to send people home at some point in the future, but there isn't, and as such, Europeans are faced with the prospect of being forced endlessly to absorb ever more people from broken nations, which will eventually make them minorities in their own lands. This isn't racism - it's reality - and you don't have to be a racist to see it	1	train
5702	Personally, I agree with those who view multiculturalism as Anathema to a Nation State System. Whoever governs a Nation must impose their values on the whole. Today, Obama imposes his cultural /philosophical mindset on all Americans. Any new leader will do likewise. The ONLY way that multiculturalism can work is if people choose Kingdom Economics. My model eliminates all human rulers. All human Government is abolished. If people desire multiculturalism, they need to rethink their philosophy of government. As of today, I understand why the Swedish Democrats desire a policy of less immigration. Think about Kingdom Economics, if you seriously desire a multicultural society. D	0	train
5703	And by the way these people represent abt 30% of the population and possibly more. Voters that have brain but not yet voting will do that as soon as the incompetent socialists and commies dears to have re-election. Of course they criminally changed the roles to be able to still sit there, but election they can not stop. Then all these mouselovers can go to Syria themselfes and we can turn back the country to normal - without the red disgusting peopledestroying leftists.	1	train
5704	This is reality for my country today... Sometimes I cry wondering what will happen to the country that my parents helped build. What will happen to my family, friends, myself, womens right to abortion and right to work outside the home. Gay and handicapped peoples right to have children are also treathened by SD... I no longer feel apart of this country and NO longer am I proud of being swedish...	0	train
5705	Hey, lets send someone from Swedish press across the pond to interview some of your nazis and paint them up as representatives of your country! Some of these problems discussed are very real. But these people will not be the ones to solve them. Should this party form a goverment and start appointing ministers from within thier ranks, thats where the real problems will start. A bunch of immigrants commiting various crimes we can handle. It will take time but we will get on top of it. Refugees eating up wellfare? No problem, we've gone through worse. Some former hooligan-skinhead-neo-nazi types becoming the Minister of Education, Finances, Defence, Health etc. Now that kind of damage would be alot harder to heal.	1	train
