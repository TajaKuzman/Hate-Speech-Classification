these refugees adult males are cowards for not defending their homeland	0
They are all mentally jerking off to the refugee crisis, always showing little kids and exhausted women. How come all we see in Europe are angry young male economic migrants.	0
You only see what you want to see. Pretty much like ostrich.	1
Delfina Jones are you one of the Donald Trump's Sidechicks?	1
Europeans who immigrated during WW2 weren't bringing Islam with them and their stupid demands to accommodate their medieval views. They weren't burning embassies and rioting when someone drew a picture of a pedophile prophet.	0
Delfina Jones a Merry Christmas to all British racists	0
Peter Hallam, Islam is not a race. I don't care about peoples sexuality, nationality or race, but religion is a choice. Being a moderate Muslim is like being a moderate nazi or moderate kkk member. You might be the most peaceful human being but your views are still stupid and incompatible with western values and democracy.	0
Delfina Jones because anything that isn't western means it's immediately bad. Wow, just...let me bash my head over the sheer amount of stupidity in your comments...	0
Sagal Aden I've never said that. All said was that Muslim values are not compatible with western. If you beg to differ than name one positive thing that Islam introduced in Europe.	1
Sagal Aden I don't wanna go anywhere but you must admit that it should be rather troubling if you can't even name one thing. Hiding behind sarcasm won't work. No need for sources either, you could mention something you think was positive for the west. But you can't. I, however, can list many negative examples your stupid cult caused in Europe.	0
Esin Ayse Kaya Islam is not compatible with western beliefs. Unless it reforms there is no place for it in Europe. We spent decades fighting for tolerance for gay people and sexual freedom for women. We don't need some cult trying to push us back.	1
Sorry if the west doesn't ignore the danger of Islam as you wish. Your insults mean nothing. Yes of course, everyone is Aware that not every Muslim is a danger to society, but to ignore the portion who do wish harm to the west would be even more ignorant.	1
You could be made a refugee at some point of your life, have some compassionate lady or its best to keep silent.	1
Islam gave women rights just like Saudi Arabia allowed them to vote to give them the illusion of rights too. Women in Muslim countries have no rights like women do in the west. I wonder how your parents and brothers would have reacted if you decided to announce to them you were becoming an atheist, putting a mini skirt on and going to spend a weekend at your boyfriend's house. I have read Quran and its misogyny is transparent. Also women rights are non existent in Muslim countries because they have religious laws, not secular laws. There is a lot of ex Muslim women who were raised in Islam and say the same thing. Also, you have completely ignored my question again.	1
Yet each one of these countries implements religious laws, each is a backward hole where women are treated like cattle, Turkey is the most normal one because funnily enough is also the least religious. The only times when Islamic countries were advancing was when religion was pushed aside, such as during Sha in Iran.	1
Esin Ayse Kaya it's great that your dad was like this, unfortunately there's very few really moderate Muslims. You're definitely western enough and so was your dad but the majority of Muslims in Europe would like sharia law.	1
You can shut up if you want. Actually that would be highly preferred. :)	0
I see that you're a blonde, case close.	1
Gialeigh Liou , I don't disregard others opinions but I'm standing by to what I said. Everyone's welcome in my country as long as they are willing to assimilate with regards to local values and culture which majority of Muslim immigrants have failed. And your argument where you have brought up the crusades is pathetic, the best you can do is bring up 12th century events? Do you know which century we currently have? If Islam is going through violent stages then I'd like for it to be going through it in Middle East and Africa, not in Europe where all I care about is the safety of my family and friends.	1
"And ladies and gentlemen, the example is above, Naaz Dhalla listing positives of sharia law...lmao. This is what's coming, and it's all good since women have ""certain rights"" and they dont rebel so it must be good for them."	1
David Olend For the west to be longsighted and not support extremists groups at the sake of making money or short term goals. ISIS would not be anywhere as powerful as it is today if western powers didn't illegally occupy iraq and completely remove all army personnel and councillors. Borders were left open and many ex-soldiers started working with al qaeda to fight the occupation. Al qaeda was non existant during Saddam's time. It simply wasn't there. ISIS is an offshoot of al qaeda. The west supported and financed al qaeda against the Russians in Afghanistan. Also the west's attempt of removing bashar by supplying weapons to the ''moderate rebels'' in Syria was just stupid. A lot of these weapons ended up with ISIS making them stronger. We all know that the west supports Saudi Arabia, a big funder of extremists organisations. Saudi Arabia is the UK's biggest purchaser of weapons. The less powerful ISIS and Al Qaeda are the less propaganda there is to brainwash people with. There are many factors leading to the mess we are in and the west's middle east policy is one factor.	1
David, I wish I knew. If I had that knowledge I would definitely share it. They are sheltered and misguided, their women uneducated, their men brought up with ideas that they are superior. How does one deal with any brainwashed group? Way before this issue came to Europe, I grew up seeing it in Turkey. Yes, Turkey is not run by Sharia law but there are still extreme individuals who take it into their own hands. The only thing I've seen work, and very slowly, is just to start educating those children. Have the next generation more knowledgeable about the world.	0
Hadi Jawad You are absolutely correct in your analysis of who is responsible for the creation of ISIS. But that wasn't the topic of discussion between Esin Ayse Kaya and myself. There is an immediate threat spreading through Europe at the moment. One that needs to be immediately eliminated.	1
David Olend I think what Esin meant was that eduction is the key to fighting religious extremism and it's true. That's why Europe needs to stop allowing for so much religious freedom including religious schools etc. Schools need to be secular ,no headscarves in schools, teach Muslim kids since they are little that it's ok to be gay, that women are equal to men etc. This is by the way the least we can do on top of stopping immigration from Muslim countries. I am pro EU but I'd advocate for abolishing of the schengen zone after what Merkel has done.	1
Delfina Jones 1. you just told me that I was sarcastic behind the screen but clearly I wasn't. Do you even know what it even means? . 2. You're telling me that I did not name ONE positive thing that Islam gave to the west. Are you blind? I gave you a very clear point and i STRENGTHEND it with sources. They are NOT opinions. They are clear and strong FACTS. unlike what you babble about 3. You're just repeating the exact same thing: Calling me stupid, making insults about my religion and then telling me that I'm wrong because...your opinion? So to conclude: You are the reason why I wanna bash my head on a wall and forget that I ever read your comments. and please, oh wise one, I challenge you. Name ONE thing that makes islam bad.	1
Sagal Aden I have never called you stupid, but you very conveniently haven't addressed the points I have made. I have already pointed out many things that are bad about Islam: you almost worship a man who was a rapist and a pedophile, your book says that women can be raped if taken into slavery, your book allows a man to take 4 wives yet a woman isn't allowed 4 husbands, is she. Your religion requires total submission, shames women, doesn't allow them to make free choices. You haven't given me any positives about Islam, you have referred to very far past, again what has Islam brought to the west in last 30 years apart from misery, honour killings, bombings, rapes etc. Even Salman Rashdie had fatwa issued against him because he criticized Islam. I'm sorry but your religion doesn't merit respect because it's a religion. It's a choice and represents certain views and ideology and it will be subjected to judgment.	1
"to not respect a religion it is not the same thing to not respect the people !!!And this is what so many Muslims of our days don t want to understand (and imedialtely call the others ""racists ) ! You, as Muslims, should change your own religion and bring it to our days .2016 (almost ) and then nobody will have nothing to say about it .So ,depends on your capacity to understand this !"	1
Hadi Jawad Tell me if you agree with the facts and opinions presented in this video. http://www.israelvideonetwork.com/the-untold-story-of-violent-muslim-opinions-graphic-warning/	1
"Delfina Jones 1. I don't worship a pedophile. I respect and adore a prophet. Placing him into the category of a pedophile is beyond pathetic as he lived 1400 YEARS. 1400 years. People change in 1400 years. In the future, people would call us pedophiles for marrying people at the age of 20-28. That's the problem that you don't seem to understand. It was a norm to marry women at a young age. How can I call someone who lived more than a thousand years ago a rapist if it was a normal thing for EVERY human on the planet at that point to marry young females? Marriage is also a choice in islam. I'm a young woman yet my parents don't force me to marry at a young age. THAT is culture. A culture that has ruined the true image of islam by mixing its own blend to make islam look ""nice"" for them. But it isn't. 2. Slavery is allowed but we rather call it housekeeping as slavery basically means a slave being owned to a master and does everything that the master tells him to do. Islam is against that as it says that all ""slaves"" should wear the same clothes as the master, eat at the dinnertable with its master and to not be forced to do work that is beyond their strength...kind of sounds like a familymember to me. You're not allowed to rape anyone because that is considered Zina: an act that is forbidden by Allah. And the whole marriage by 4 women but women can only marry 1 man: I don't remember exactly but it was something to do with there being more women than men in our world (because war). However, that doesn't mean that a man can just randomly go get a second wife just like that. He has to ask his first wife and if she agrees (nowadays a i doubt that), he has to go through his finances so he knows that he's able to take care of a second. I doubt even more that there will be a woman that would want to share their love for a husband with another which makes it harder for a man to find a second wife. If men aren't capable of taking care of one wife (as it says in the quran but you don't seem to care about that), the man MUST settle with having one. Also, nowehere in the quran does it state how many husbands a woman can have but yes it does say a man can have 4 wives. For women, it would mean that she could marry as many as she pleases (though WHY would a woman wanna do that? I don't wanna have more than one husband and I know for certain that we would enjoy putting our efforts and love for one guy and not many and men would not enjoy having to share their love for one woman but some regions in the world have different norms (which i'm TRYING TO POINT OUT because the prophet and those who lived with him existed in a different time with DIFFERENT norms). Today we have somewhat the same norms but because of differences in timeline, we change alot for the better but know that we can follow the same norms. It's just that it's very important to make everyone and God happy . 2. Slavery is allowed but we rather call it housekeeping as slavery basically means a slave being owned to a master and does everything that the master tells him to do. Islam is against that as it says that all ""slaves"" should wear the same clothes as the master, eat at the dinnertable with its master and to not be forced to do work that is beyond their strength...kind of sounds like a familymember to me. You're not allowed to rape anyone because that is considered Zina: an act that is forbidden by Allah. And the whole marriage by 4 women but women can only marry 1 man: I don't remember exactly but it was something to do with there being more women than men in our world (because war).

If men aren't capable of taking care of one wife (as it says in the quran but you don't seem to care about that), the man MUST settle with having one. 3. You want to know the positives that Islam has brought 30 YEARS FROM NOW? You weren't being clear with your point as you challenged me to state the positive things that Islam has brought to the west. I did but you are so reluctant to holding on to your opinion because 30 years ago, many ARABIC countries, not islamic, ARABIC countries decided to rebel against their leaders, resulting in new leaders and more rebellious groups are formed to overthrow the leaders. They use anything that is necessary to take down the leader and when they do, they have NO IDEA on how to govern at all. Are these muslims? Of course not. If strongly hold on to your actions and blame people when clearly there were better options (peace deals), then you're not a muslim. You're an idiot. Ignorant idiots. 4. The BIGGEST issue that I have with people criticizing isla m is that they point out issues with countries and how they govern. Both sides (the west AND ""muslim"" countries) are doing everything they can, knowingly and unknowingly sabbotaging the religion that once stated that through knowledge and peace, there will be victory. The problem isn't interely muslim countries, it's nationalism. It still exists and is the main reason why many have such hatred and rage towards others. even countries considered ""muslim"" have a grudge against each other (look at Saudi Arabia and Iran). Islam is a religion that unifies people, wether colour, race, sex, age or ethnicity. All it takes is an open mind and you might learn things beyond the screams and echoes from the media. I have watched Christianity and its history, I have seen the issues with Zionism vs Judaism, I have heard of people who believe in Buddhism but do terrible acts against others. WE humans are responsible for OUR actions and what we bring forth to our religion. Islam is always waiting for people to listen to it but many have always glared behind for other things and sometimes turned their cheeks. I CAN BRING a good image of Islam and I can also BRING a bad image of it aswell but Islam as a whole is never changed. It stays the same. Only I can become distorted or bad. THAT is why you see muslims bombing themselves and killing in the name of God: They are enraged, confused and don't know about Islam. When you live in a place where foreigners (US) have bombed, destroyed unity, taken their properties and placed terrible leaders there, what are the odds that you end up becoming confused of the situation, just like many, and do everything necessary to take back the good times. Suddenly you get it back but what CAN you do? You don't know how to govern, you know how to fight. All rebellious groups start out well, fighting for justice and then suddenly along the way, they become confused and even mad with power and strength that God has given them, only to use it to hurt others and blame God for that. There is a problem in these places but to solve it, PEOPLE NEED TO STOP BALING EVERYTHING ON ISLAM AND GET THEIR BUTTS OFF OF THESE PLACES and I'm talking mainly about the US. PS: My religion is MY choice but just like you have your choice, I wish to respect it and the same should go with you."	1
Are you human, Delfina Jones? When your ancestral lot thrashed themselves at the mercy of other foreign lands, others gave welcome to them. How can you be such a sociopath to feel comfortable enough to suggest that people in need be shut out? You are sick. Can we just shut up about you, Delfina? Can you just return to your residence and get out of your holiday picture area? Perhaps you should be excluded from travel to other holiday destinations?	0
"Because most of them aren't in need you naive fool. Bbc is showing you these heartbreaking images of refugees while in reality most of them settled in Libanon and Jordan and the rest is dying. Those that come to Europe are greedy violent opportunists and economic migrant. But like a naive fool that you obviously are you believe in everything that leftist media shows you, Robert Hidalgo. And that ""holiday destination"" is in my own country, moron."	0
Hadi Jawad I am familiar with UN statistics. I was talking about make immigrants from countries other than Syria who traveled to Europe. Even Syrian refugees however broke the law when they refused to register in Hungary and demanded to go to Germany and Sweden, countries with the highest welfare. If you're escaping from a war torn country to be safe, then you're safe but you're very poor so you go to another country which is also not good enough so you travel through 9 more to get to the best one then you're not a refugee. Also that 64% of men are cowards, west should arm them and send them to fight isis just like our grandparents fought the nazis.	0
The real solution for refugee crisis is if you don't like refugees, than stop making them refugees by bombing their homelands !!! Dimwits	0
White House created the mujahideen, Alqaida, Isis and Talibans. Hillary and tony Blair already have accepted the charges. Muppet!! Only inhumans could kill millions of Native Americans to establish their imperialist Govt. To what religion did these bombers of Hiroshima & Nagasaki belong? To what religion belonged the killers of 5 million Iraqi civilians who invaded their country in search of non existent WMD! Double standards yield twisted judgments... To what religion did Hitler belong?	0
USA use atomic bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki And come to Iraq to judge Saddam Hussein because he use chemical weapons as they claim USA government us the evil in earth and they call us terrorist	1
There's war and then there's rapists paedophilia atrocities and the Geneva convention NO HUMAN SHOULD SUFFER what Hitler did and what these vile subhumans are doing today I don't see anybody forcing their hands!!	0
Azim you are absolutely right regarding the cause for all of this misery... The CIA should have stayed the hell out of everyone else's business...

It's good as long as they stay in the Middle East...	1

Propaganda!! Laughing up their sleeves that we're falling for the sob stories. 'Let's put some kids & women out there& the west will fall for it'!	1
Russia’s increased activity along the Syrian-Turkish border signifies the closing phases of the Syrian conflict. With Syrian and Kurdish forces holding the border east of the Euphrates, the Afrin-Jarabulus corridor is the only remaining conduit for supplies bound for terrorists in Syria to pass…..When this corridor is closed and supplies cut off, ISIS, Nusra, and all associated NATO-backed factions will atrophy and die as the Syrian military restores order across the country… With that support being cut off and the prospect of these militants being eradicated, the true sponsors behind this conflict are moving more directly and overtly to salvage their failed conspiracy against the Syrian state. What we see emerging is what was suspected and even obvious all along – a proxy war started by, and fought for Western hegemonic ambitions in the region, intentionally feeding the forces of extremism, not fighting them http://off-guardian.org/2015/12/19/why-the-west-can-never-defeat-or-forgive-russia/	1
"Saudi Arabia, one of the wealthiest nations on the planet, has an air conditioned tent city which can house millions. How about instead of trying to guilt the people of Western democratic societies into resettling these ""refugees"" you do so with the wealthy Gulf States; who refuse to resettle their brethren, who follow the same Islamic ideology which is incompatible with Western democratic values."	1
I guess we can thank the Labour party for all this world crisis and migrant problems. I hope corbyn and Co can house some in their homes? Yeah right!	1
The Military Industrial complex, the Central Banks and corruption from people like Hillary and Obama among all of their accomplices are to blame. Every politician that votes for every war has their campaigns funded by war contractors and in many cases owns stock in the war contractors. Weapons used to be made to fight wars, now wars are created to sell weapons then steal control of the resources.	1
This site sure is pushing the Propaganda a lot lately	1
What I find funny are people who jump to respond to my comment thinking I give a crap what they think..	0
Christine Madden What are you even talking about , and what does your response have to do with anything..god people are so petty	0
It is about a mysoginist ideology non Western lifestyle upon us and we cant debate it for fear of label or worse.	0

How no mention of Denmark making them pay searching them for assets great idea . The ones coming here have money the ones not have nothing that's why they stay in camps . Wonder how many are well of get here and claim benefits.and have thousands put away	1

America needs to protect and provide for Americans!!!!	1
BBC just stop lying in general about these countries and the crisis! I'm getting really fed up with this one-sided disgusting propaganda! I know it's not strictly a response to this video, but please let me say this. These people (I'm perfectly aware that not all of them, but most) are very agressive, when they don't get what they want. They demonstrated it very well at the Hungarian-Serbian border two days ago. BBC always shows crying children. But the fact is they're crying, because they are used in order to get sympathy and when they get tossed around they just get scared of the yelling and agression. They're crying because the migrants' actions make them cry. Not the Hungarians, Croatians or Serbians, The migrants always use babies or little children as shields. How can they do this to those poor kids? And they're called 'refugees' by BBC...yeah some refugees these are.... There are leaders among them who tell the crowd what to do via megaphones. Yeah obviously when you're fleeing from danger you must carry megaphones with you in your backpacks...yeah right. And the fact that BBC is assisting this Trojan horse move is outrageous!	0
What I think should be done is back in Syria, more young men who are fit to fight should fight ISIS and the government need to put more funding into that (I am aware that the UK are helping to train rebels against Assad and ISIS already).	1
You are narrow minded. Of course they will be aggressive!!!!!!! They are tired, hungry, some will be poorly and be faced with a no at the borders you know? BECAUSE THEY ARE HUMAN!!!!!!!!	0
Janine Ewen First of all, don't you dare yell at me, lady! Second, I refuse to be called narrow-minded! I've never been and I'll never will be. I do understand both sides. However, agression is NEVER acceptable!!! I'm sorry that this is acceptable to you. When they'll end up in the UK, you'll see it with your own eyes! Stop making excuses for them, when you live thousands of kilometers away and you're completely clueless! WE ARE HUMAN TOO and we have rights too. Our country turned into a dump, because of all the rubbish they leave behind and they are agressive. Listen to me, very carefully Janine, we will not tolerate this behavior. This is a civilized, European country, not the Middle East. These savages threw blocks of concrete rocks at our police and 20 of them got injured and they treat their children like dirt. Shame on them and shame on you for being a narrow-minded, uneducated person!	0
Simone Tocco I understand your point of view. However, excuse me for saying this, but you don't have to deal with nearly as much influx as we do. You get about 400 people a day, we get 3000-8000 a day. There's a bit of a difference there. Yes, it's great that you shelter them, we did too, but they revolted and refused to register according to EU law. And again, excuse me for pointing this out, but what you do doesn't really help the EU. You don't stop them, you just let them through and all of them will flood the UK eventually. Let's be realistic here, most of them are not refugees, they're just looking for a better life. It's great, but Europe's benefits system will collapse under the pressure if we let millions in. There's a much better life in America for example, still i'm not gonna go there, be agressive and demand my rights, while I don't fulfill my obligations.	0
Agnes Toma, people never like hearing the truth. here is the US it was similar with the South American refugees that where coming (and still are) in scores and the media kept showing children, but not the parents who were abandoning them, throwning these children over the fenses (literally) to forcibly gain entrance into the country. So 7k are placed in my city and state & the crime is immeasurable. Child killings, torture & abductions are higher than ever. Heroin & needle deali dealing is everywhere. Muggings, home invasions and school violence is uncontrollable and domestic violence, well its all day everyday. All this started within a month after the placement of the refugees into the US and 18 months after their placement is way at all just really started to tear down and it's just become a war zone in the state of Massachusetts. The people don't want to believe that these things happen and that people who illegally push their way in or force their way into a country are somehow good and decent and loving and caring and want to make a better life for themselves. It's just not true.	1

What a media didnt shows you is this.

But the migrants try to get to Greece and Bulgaria. Greece and Bulgaria are safe. But the migrants try to get to Romania and Hungary. Romania and Hungary are safe. But the migrants try to get to Austria. Austria is safe. But migrants try to get to Germany. Germany is safe. But migrants try to get to Sweden. These people are NOT refugees. Refugees are people who get to a safe country and ASK for help; which the country then either supplies if it can, or ASKS other countries to supply if it cannot (which is where we come in). People who arrive in a safe country and decide its not quite what they are after, and so march through safe countries to find one they do want, are NOT refugees. They are economic migrants.	0
Michael you just jelious because no one want to go to Romania ? :D We can send you some to take them home	1
George Thornton, so when will you be adopting these families into your home? Go ahead I'll wait.	1
Michael Strömpl Oh it's rich...so a Romanian is trying to educate me on humanity meanwhile you guys are being nasty and discriminate against Hungarians living in Transylvania all the time! Oh by the way, I'm a law student, so no I wouldn't qualify myself as 'brain-dead' thank you very much. Let me ask you, dear: since when is islam a 'race'? Here, I'll help you: it's a religion. Looks like you're the brain-dead one here after all. I don't know what they teach you at that university in Bucharest, but the very basics are certainly missing... This is elementary school level knowledge, my friend. Oh and FYI: I don't hate the islam religion, the only things I hate are agression and terrorism!	0
"Syrian president planed it, . He said it well it will come to u ""europe"". .... superpowers should rethink about putting nose in mid East..... .... after 15years will u be surprised to see boom blasts in Europe on large scale"	1
Today Croatia send the migrants to Hungary around 11000 people. We cant do anyithing with them.... They said dont want to be register in Hungary and Austria or Croatia they want to be register Germany or Sweden. They can choose whatever they want they dont need to follow the law. Hmm this is gonna be interesting . When is the European union will talk about this? Where is a Nato? Why they not go there to fix the problem. Where is the Un? Un is complaining about Hungary why they not send troops to make peace ? Hmm	1
Janine Ewen Hungry ? Really? Did you see what you're wasted ? Discard the food ! .There Is a lot of hungry a lot of the Hungarian people and children here in our country who can not get anything .. In addition, there is no law to him , they do what they want and do not prevent anyone! Hungary of the Hungarians , Hungarian law everybody has to adhere !!!	1
I am afraid it is not BBC only.... most western media is doing exactly the same. Huffington post, Sky news and the list goes on. One sided, misleading information was everywhere for an entire week Hungary was on the front page of all the UK newspapers but other issues like arson attacks on refugee camps in Germany, people sleeping on the street in Austria, ( just a side note both of these countries had more time to prepare for the influx of migrants....) violent behaviour towards police were not reported.Mass manipulation at its best..... But looking at the comments I am glad to see that most people cannot be mislead and started to realise how the media is trying to influence them. Also well done for explaining what is happening in Hungary, without going down to a certain level. As I said in my other comments it will be interesting to see how those who refuse to register will be integrated when they cannot respect the first law about border control.....	1
I was wondering if this biased reporting may actually be arranged by the governments. Perhaps they want to be seen as compliant and humanitarian but actually fear a Muslim spread in Europe. Maybe they are afraid that if they don't help, Muslim countries will attack Europe. Or maybe they know we'll retaliate and argue that they are doing the wrong thing and that lawless people are not welcome so they will have democratic votes against what the UN is proposing. Just can't stand to think they could really be this stupid!	0
We don't even know who these children are. They don't have any, or reliable, papers. They could be orphans taken along to provide just the sort of cover needed to create sympathy. 70 % of the people storming the EU are able bodied men who shoul be fighting for and protecting their homeland. Traditional refugees are women and children...not men. So they have abandoned their countries, abandoned, who knows how many women, children and elderly to fend for themselves. Cowards or potential terrorists?	0
In two years these migrants will be thinking of building pressure cooker bombs. They will NEVER integrate. We will have arab ghettos and arab schools. Look what is already happening in France. Wake up Europe !!	0
The agenda is destabilization. Causing a religious war to reduce population and increase atheism. http://bit.ly/1dIIefe	1
Simone Tocco You have compared the Hungarian refugees from 1956 to the Syrian refugees. You have called our attention to brush up our memory, now I'd like to ask You to do the same. ;-) In 1956 the Hungarians immediately after crossing the border e.g. to Austria they went to the local authorities and co-operated with them. The Hungarians stayed in the refugee-camp as long as they were ordered to do so and left the camps only when they were allowed to. The Hungarians have used their passports to identify themselves and have accepted the registration process. The Hungarians have left the refugee-camps only to that country which accepted them upon their registration data. The Hungarians did not attack the border/fence/soldiers/policemen etc of other countries but they did everything to follow the rules and traditions of the given foreign country. And at last there were only 200.000 Hungarians, while there are 4.000.000 Syrian refugees. The Syrian refugees do not stay in their neighbour countries but they move toward to other countries upon their guess and without any documents. They cross green borders without permit and they do not want to use the OPEN border stations, although those are OPEN. They do not want themselves to be registrated and do not want to stay in the refugee-camps. Instead of co-operating with the local authorities, they attack the borders and the policemen. They do not stay in refugee-camps and do not accept any help (food, drink etc) from the local authorities and churches but money. They do not use even the provided waste bins, but they simply throw their litter to everywhere. They do not want to follow the local law and traditions but show aggressive behaviour. I accept that their norms are different to ours, and that there is a big cultural difference. But it seems to me that at the present only we (Europeans) act tolerantly while they stick to their rigid customs. It is hard to imagine any real co-operation with them if they do not change their attitude.	0
Islamist takeover of northern europe is well under way all european countries should reinstate proper borders as a matter of urgency !	0
A container full of weapons trying to be smuggled ino Greece was found !!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Its men of fighting age who are mostly tryn to get to europe. Where is the woman and children. This says it all im afraid	1
Ekama Noieau you don't need weapons.... Minds are the most powerful and destructive weapons ever created. Europe will be receiving over a million refugees that do not have any clue what we are, just thinking that we are responsible for their loses.	1
Are you guys seriously being racist or just joking?	0
And their minds are less scientific, less methodical, less logical and less organised than our's, they can squabble and protest but at the first sign of major trouble they will be put down. They are not a major threat to us or our culture because we are stronger, smarter and vastly better equipped than they are. They either integrate or they fall through the cracks. Personally, I think the risks of rejecting them are far higher than accepting them. Accepted they are split up, put all over europe, in different communities, rejected they return together to their own countries blaming us for their problems.	0
Ekama Noieau They have something European don't have and it is NUMBERS Most every family from those countries, have more children per capita than european families .And in many cases they do not work , you will paying for all those children and extra wives	1
Ekama Noieau they will reject Europe, but the pull factors such as financial benefits and safety are stronger than the willingness to return to their third world countries cause Syria was never a first world country.	0
Ekama Noieau!!! Our minds are less scientific!!! Great finding!!! Is this acceptable logicaly,reasonably. What about American clock boy!!! Most Syrian are University graduate and alot of us invented a lot of things but no one was caring if them!!! We have a lot of great doctors who are even more Cleve than European doctors.your opinion is silly and not logical	0
I'm not saying biologically Farhan, I'm saying culturally, they receive less education in Syria, there's less security, freedom of expression etc, Clock Boy was raised in America, he is ethnically Syrian, but he is culturally American. Hence I would consider him American. This isn't a race thing, I'm talking about these refugees, who, on average, are as I stated them to be, if they weren't their country wouldn't have collapsed. And if they were responsible they'd be reaping the benefits right now. They're fleeing poverty, war and dictatorial government, they're not a threat to us, all they bring is competition, which spurs the economy, innovation and a population boost, as long as the EU splits the load evenly these migrants/refugees will be a net gain for Europe, the way it's currently being managed though is that Germany will be overrun, fuelling tensions, spreading fear and causing problems, the burden needs to be shared for this to work.	1
"""And their minds are less scientific, less methodical, less logical and less organised than our's""... and Ben says he can´t see the racism in the comments. Are you stupid?"	0
We need a firm - but compassionate - repatriation programme	1
Carl Bennet Nienaber A person who has received a primarily Islamic education will be less scientific, less methodical and less logical, that is obvious and has nothing to do with race, that would be applicable whether they were Syrian or Swedish. Some are refugees, some are migrants.	0
Yes, if you think in racial terms, the term 'we' to me means Britons, individuals born in Britain, which include a wide variety of ethnicities, who receive a British education and are raise around British culture, and so have developed better critical thinking skills and understanding of the world than their average Syrian counterpart, so although I would not consider these refugee/migrants ever British, their children could be, as opposed to sending them home where their children will be born into deprivation and conflict, and so more likely to become the next generation of militants. I may very likely be termed a cultural supremacist, but I am not racist at all, I think interbreeding is the best way to assure positive trajectory, mongrelisation assures greater vigour and superior genetics, as can be demonstrated in all animals.	0
I hate Islam and its brainwashed followers	0
How will they buy Ferraris with the burden of refugees on their shoulders? Arabs are selfish.	0
Arabs are natural liars, western journalists are stupid enough to believe them!	0
Nah,They're too busy building massive sky scrapers with billions of money,they won't even let a single refugee in.	1
Cuz they know they are crazy	0
But really can people can be so ignorant! pranoid,not everyone dream England,a bit of humility do not make damage...get informed,only the 5 per cent arrive here,the 95 is in the middle east.	0
Slowly the Muslim terror snakes it way to Europe.	1
Yea slowly as the europe done before in middle east. Now time has come to live with worries for europe like middle east	1
Imam tells Muslim migrants to 'breed children' with Europeans to 'conquer their countries' and vows: 'We will trample them underfoot, Allah willing' Sheikh Muhammad Ayed gave the speech at Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.He said Americans, Italians, Germans and French forced to take refugees,Claims Europe was only welcoming refugees as a source of labour . A top Iman has told Muslims to use the migrant crisis to breed with European citizens and 'conquer their countries'. He said Europe was facing a demographic disaster and urged Muslims to have children with westerners so they could 'trample them underfoot, Allah willing.' 'Throughout Europe, all the hearts are enthused with hatred toward Muslims. They wish that we were dead, but they have lost their fertility, so they look for fertility in our midst,' Infowarsreports. 'We will give them fertility. We will breed children with them, because we shall conquer their countries.'	1
I will salt the earth with the blood of swine and march my army of Judea through your hearts to crush your heathenistic godless souls.	1
You heard it here folks , as houris has spoken , their intentions are clear , to overthrow European governments and inhabitants , with their own misinterpreted views , we need to act now , the fret is real , Europe is been invaded , close each border , don't feed them ,give them water and tell them to move along and go back where they came and gets refund from the people smugglers !	0
"""Umutcan Sarigul Yea slowly as the europe done before in middle east. Now time has come to live with worries for europe like middle east"" no dear, the western society is not that islamic mess that's the middle east, you can keep killing each other down there, you're not going to do this in Europe, you can count on it."	0
Francesco Cesco But they ARE doing it. They did on 7/7, they did it in France w/ the Charlie Hedbo massacre, they did in the US w/ 9/11. There are some places across Europe where the police will not even tread anymore b/c they've become so islamized and taken over. They are doing it.. slowly but surely through civilization jihad.	1
Cynthia, no you are correct - but when you responded the way you did to the terrorist threat, we supported you. Now fast forward a few years, and we have OUR citizens being killed on our streets, and on the beach when they are on holiday. We also have terrorists being recruited from within our own country - plotting against us, and going to Syria to fight for ISIS. With ISIS openingly declaring they will send more terrorists to Europe disguised as refugees, are you still saying we should keep our borders open? I can't fly to LAX without security checks, so I can't see that Syrians would be able to.. so why should it be any different for Europe than the US? (Of course, I fully expect you to ignore these questions, the same as every other time a yank comments on these threads does... but that proves the point really - you can talk a good game, but have nothing to back it up).	1
Yes you responded and joined Bush in declaring a bogus war in Iraq that led to the formation of Isis. Congratulations again! Pat yourselves on the back.	1
What are you backing up? Say it. Say I hate Muslims period and quit trying to defend your actions with examples of terrorism. In the United States, I'm much more concerned about being shot by a mentally deranged white man with a legally purchased gun and not a Mexican immigrant which come here by the millions yearly.	1
A yank started this post. You have no problem with racist yanks, do you fascist?	0
It's clear enough to anyone that would read the comments on here - or even just try to understand my last comment. I will repeat - we have terrorists killing our citizens NOW - and we have terrorists in THIS COUNTRY plotting to kill our citizens NOW. We also have people recruiting muslims in this country to go and fight alongside ISIS right NOW. I have never said I hate Muslims - I hate terrorists, period. I hate extremists and fundamentalists that want to harm us, and our society, regardless of their race, religion, or ideology. You may have a right to be more concerned about your own citizens than immigrants - I do not know enough about US crime stats.. but that doesn't mean the situation is the same here. As I said, you wouldn't let me fly to LAX without passing security checks, so (in view of the ongoing threat we live with on a daily basis) why should we let anyone they want to walk in to Europe?	0
Just seen your fascist comment... I do not think that word means what you think it means... but it says a lot about your bigotry, seeing as you know nothing about me.	0
lol - you not been watching the news then? Germany shut their border when they couldn't cope!! Hungary have arrested at least one confirmed terrorist on their border. People are moving freely across borders and disappearing. And I ask again, what are you doing as a person, or a country, to help? Can you not see that the current situation is being used to rid you of any responsibility? If the refugees were in camps in Turkey etc, the UN would call on you to help... if they are artificially dispersed the UN can avoid a crisis, and the US can wash it's hands.	1
This is going to cause so much trouble. Countries cannot support this amount of migrants.	1
One rule for one, one rule for another. Its the same here. They can always find money for people abroad but we face numerous cut backs	1
That is the problem. The secret weapon of islam is over population.	1
The annoying thing is that 75% of the migrants are Young men, why aren't they fighting for THEIR country? Or is it more a case of they can get more from European countries (money, house,education etc)	1
Cowards	0
because according to source 80 % are not Syrians!	1
because the majority of them arent syrian!!!! many of them are even former rebel fighters.	0
These are draft dodgers who didn't want to fight for their governments they would rather fight jihad on the West because they support the rebels.	1
We must stand with Hungary...AND start sending them back who have been in Europe for generations, these are christian countries and need to stay so...but the Idiots running the show seem to want to turn them over to Islam...the vast majority of the public in european countries think the same way...instead of showing muslim dead babies..start reporting on the muslim men making Sweden into the rape capital of Europe...Viktor Orban should be running Europe.	0
Gabri Ela not sure I'd use the notoriously racist newspaper the daily mail as a source for unbiased facts!	0
Wait until they all finally force there way to Germany. There will be nowhere for them to go. Then the demands start and the riots. Then those idiots Moon, Junker and Merkel will be forcing their mistakes on the rest of Europe to get Germany out of trouble......	0
BBC please report the truth. This is nothing but the spread of Islam in Europe and soon they will multiply and dominate Europe. You foolish news agencies are enhancing this because you are all blind and stupid. When the bombs begin to blow up there will be no hiding place even for you.

the BBC is run by champagne socialist lefties living of the tax payer.	1
Emmanuel Nnaji the truth doesnt suit their agenda driven narrative.	1
The hungarians are correct it is an invasion, and it is aided and abbeted by the BBC and Sky news . If you watch either of them you would think it was all women and children , the reality is that it is 95% men and very few of them are actually Syrian . We need to defend our borders and keep these people out or we will pay a heavy price in blood.	1
First major problem the EU have had to deal with & the politicians turn to jelly. What a surprise.	1
I agree. What did we all expect from a bunch of individuals most of whom failed spectacularly to achieve anything in politics in their own countries? MEPs are second rate politicians - and they are being given increasing powers over the sovereignty of individual countries (now referred to as 'member states'!). Added to this, our respective governments are being influenced by a biased media who are only reporting one side of the story because they just love a bit of sensationalism.	1
The EU is the biggest political con in my lifetime, the cultural & economic differences between us all are huge. Whilst 2 of the greatest conflicts of recent times have been the break up of the Soviet Union & Yugoslavia, the EU wants to take Europe in the opposite direction. It cannot & will not work & the main beneficiaries are the politicians themselves. End this gravy train now.	1
They can't even make the cell phone chargers be all of the same kind, so how can they handle big politics? :)	1
Does anyone really believe that a political union of Europe is a good idea ? Apart from politicians	1
The major thing I have learned from this'migrant-crisis' is that I now know where my vote will go in the forthcoming Referendum on the EU. I will vote to leave because, like many people here who won't admit it, the thought of the UK being in some 'club' with the Germans made many feel secure; the Germans, after-all, were the clever ones whose economy was up-and-away soon after WW2, while we lagged behind for many years. However, the way they have behaved over this crisis - handing out 'sweets' to migrants etc, is symbolic of their encouragement for the migrants to travel all that way; and absolutely ridiculous - and not a thought for their own people. It has now made my mind up, and I want to leave the EU	1
A few years ago I was staunchly pro EU. But now, I agree with you 100 % ... Let's get out while we can	1
Pamela, but unfortunately those guest workers never left, and I have heard some pretty negative stories about the Turks from my foreign exchange students, who mostly are still on the bottom rung of the ladder because they will not assimilate nor do they value education. Yes there are some exceptions to the rule, but that seems to be the ideology of the majority.	1
EU is a joke!!!	0
Don't forget,that while Britain was still on rations their Government was issuing food and other help to Germany. The US was doing the same to Japan. The whole Second World War was a lie.	1
Clair Louise Bessant Too late I'm afraid. This refugee crisis is an ivasion in disguise. I don't say ISIL, because that's too obvious. But someday this will all turn bad.	1
Why can't they all go on a pilgrimage to Mecca and ask for asylum when there in Saudi Arabia its a rich moslim country and most Syrians speak Arabic it's a win win they get to go to Mecca as ever Moslim should try to do in the life and it's a safe place with 100% Islamic laws.	1
"EU is a failing club. Definitely worth leaving. I know I will be voting to leave EU! That is absolutely what my thoughts were and still are, handing out ""sweets"" to these so called refugees will only continue to encourage millions of them moving into Europe and demanding to be housed, fed and clothed!! Can we afford to do that? Well I'm afraid our children, our children's children and so on, may not have free NHS if we take thousands of these people in. They will come in and start popping babies. Schools and hospitals will be overcrowded."	1
Don't forget eventually they will all have a European passport and will be free to travel and work anywhere in the EU. Best vote to leave asap	1
Yeah...if we still alive at the time of the next election. Anything can happen and fairly soon. UK is not safe either.	1
I've just read that 4 out of 5 are not from Syria yet they still INVADE countries.....this is a disgrace and the EU leaders have just handed Europe over and then they have gone quiet......it's shocking and unacceptable and needs sorting now not discussed next Wednesday as l've just heard.....they should be discussing this now on the W/end and resolve this major mess up!!!	0
No l don't l read many.....what l don't like is how quiet the EU leaders have become as if they have opened the door and they have all left.....	1
Of course they are not! The hungarian border is full of thrown away passports. They can be any kind of citizens they want to	1
most are not syrian!!! i knew that ages ago just by looking at the crowd.	1
Merkel, world war two, terrorists , Refugees, Migrants, confusion, and arguments, rioting , disorder, lawlessness, stupidity, tensions to war, fear and threat ,racial hatred as Syrians and afgans fight, now wait for the bombings, fighting on the streets, beheading, and the destruction of Europe and it's countries , Hungary is defending it's country in a pool of sh.t , about the only country defending and upholding the EU laws. We will regret we did not see this coming and acted faster , However with a person like Merkel who should now be thrown out by the EU for misconduct to the European countries and laws and by her own people, for an open invite stupid mare, 60% Refugee 40% other or un known Migrant , It only took 7% of the wrong people in world war two to be sending the Jews to the gas chambers? do you think we have 7% ISLAMIC STATE now in Europe? the stability of Europe is about to topple and discontent in Europe will grow , We are seriously looking at total unrest leading to a possible war.......... lets hope we have a doggy bag and can pick up the Sh.T , but I fear the damage is already done, as an Island England we need to now close our borders under a total security risk and put troops not police on our southern and eastern shore line, backed up by a Navy and air cover , lets send a hard and fast message to the 40% un known stay away.	0
Garett Mullan in reply A refugee is someone who enters the first safe country and ask's for asylum , they have gone past the refugee status and are moving on forcibly through Europe using force when stopped, a lot have no papers or passport, which makes them illegal or put together illegal Migrants, Europe in the best will in the world needs to look and see who is entering their country countries can you tell me how many Islamic state are mixed in with the people forcing their way into Europe No.........it is estimated 800,000 are going to be at the borders of Germany and 300,000 will not even pass refugee status so what do you think they may be? holiday makers as for the Holocaust that only took 7% of the 800,000 thats around 11,428.half of a person around an invading army then	1
Hungary is handling it correctly, but Mad Merkel totally messed it up in creating a stampede and EU needs to do more to keep them nearer their border by improving facilities & supplies to persuade them NOT to travel to EU because it will be fine for them where they are now in Turkey and other neighboring Islamic States that have already setup Refugee camps for them. WHAT REALLY IS NEEDED IS A FULL SCALE WAR AGAINST ISIS WITHIN SYRIA & IRAQ, and once done all those so called migrants & refugees can be sent directly back to their country of origin. This will avoid another major recession due to the EU has no jobs for them, and therefore they will remain for years on State benefits while being feed, sheltered, educated and given some spending money which will destroy the social welfare system completely! ALSO, the fact that we don't know how many ISIS members & staunch supporters of them have now or will soon be infiltrating the EU & US, as many of the ones arriving have no form of identification to confirm whom they are! This is a massive financial & security disaster, and I am glad that Hungary has seen the writing on the wall regarding that fact to prevent them entering the country - Good on Hungary!	0
All this immigrants Merkel should take them to her villa and leave with them.	1
Hungary is making things worst. The migrants want to come to Germany or Scandinavia. No one wants to stay in Hungary. Hungarians are doing this simply out of xenophobia and hatred. After all they support Putin. As for the intervention against ISIS - I fully agree. It should already have been done. This is where the problem originates from. NATO should take the firmer position in this matter.	0
"In answer to the headline ""There are growing tensions among some European countries over how to handle the migration crisis"". The answer is simple, SEND THEM BACK (and to the 1st country of SAFETY - TURKEY). Don't tell me that the EU and the rest of Europe has never heard of something called a RETURN TICKET !!!"	0
The story says many of the migrants want to travel to Germany and Sweden, and both those countries want the rest of the E.U countries to share the burden with them?...Are they kidding? Sweden is now the rape capital of Europe, and they want other sane people to follow their idiotic example. https://youtu.be/RZsvdg1dkJ4	1
"But here in Hungary we can't share ANY burden like that either, the minimal salary here is only about 400 USD!!! People with some good certificates (those who has the chance to study at all!) can earn more then this, but this country is just not enough wealthy to give these ""migrants"" enough benefits, this country is enough european and 1000 years old, christian and an amazing culture, but our authorities say just like you all could read above, 80% of these migrants are not even syrian! They protested loudly here in the heart of our capital which was lived even by the Roman Empire, that they want to go to Germany, because here it'""s like Guantanamo !!! So if I scream and shout enough loud that I want to go to England, and I act like a hoard, will I be invited to London? I agree helping people escaping from war, but most of these people are NOT escaping from any war. Many from Pakistan, from African countries even."	1
They somehow don't want to cooperate with any authorities either, they don't have any papers, no ID's, no passports, and they just reject being registrated too!	1
I agree with you 100% Karli. Although you might hear that Hungary is being criticised in the news and media, let me reassure you that's not how it is in reality. You have many, many people who admire and support your countries sensible stance, and wish their own countries would do the same. They don't want to give way to media emotional blackmail, and the incredibly outrageous biased news reporting. People need to wake up to what monster they are playing with here. There is nothing wrong with wanting to protect and maintain your own country and culture. There is enough barbaric bloodshed going on in the middle east. Only a brain dead fool would want to import it into their own country.	0
They have suddenly all discovered ( far too late) that every country needed its borders! Simple really & Germany made a huge mistake saying it would take all comers anyway. Apparently only one in four of these migrants are from Syria the rest are economic migrants & no country can cope with being overrun.	1
To improve the TRP of your channel, always showing something touchy & not reality. Why Europe should take them??? Why not Muslim countries?? Where are some international organizations?? Everyone is keeping quite.	1
"The European Council fiddled whilst , Damascus ,Palmyra, Aleppo, Tripoli, Beirut & Baghdad burn. Europe your motto is united in diversity and your anthem the ode to joy. ACT don't fiddle ! Get the Arab league to act as well. Mr Blair will be of no use here either. The result of not taking quotas sending refugees to Dachau.................Cameron and Orban are you not even slightly ashamed? I am as an European Citizen. The takeover of ""civilised Europe "" by narrow minded born again non christians and boutique bankers seems nigh on complete.....let the refugees just die out of camera shot then we can all sleep easy. Thatcher's sick legacy of unadulterated selfishness."	0
This sudden exodus of migrants into Europe means a lot of cultural and political and religious implications. Analogy suggests Europe shall become an Islamic state in coming hundred years or so just because of rising population of migrants which to me seems a kind of TROJAN HORSE.	1
It's a muslim invasion. Saudi Arabia has the money, space and a massive air conditioned tent city able to hold them all. Once we are over run with muslims they can start out voting us in council elections then bigger elections and before you know it we will be living in a muslim country and the women will all be forced to wear burkas and all the disgusting things that go on in muslim countries will be going on in European countries. beheadings and stonings en-mass. hasn't Boris Johnson just been replaced by a muslim as mayor of London? And I read that that dead boy on the beach in turkey was staged, and the 'refugees' have been having weapons delivered to them. It's a planned invasion and we need to seal the borders and send those that are here back. Let the Arab nations deal with their own	0
Im confused if the migrants are escaping war in syria then surely as soon as they get to hungary and croatia then surely they have done this? Why then the need to travel to europe? Oh yeah the money and so called prospects. Ur hang on we cant feed and house the families and ex sevice men in our own countries how then can we find space and food for thousands of migrants?????? David icke is right we will all become a muslim state and women will lose the rights they fought hard to get and our children will be at risk and what was the point in 2! World wars if we all end up following muslim law?	1
"To begin with I totally agreed that the UK should accept some refugees but now - seeing all the fighting and aggression and the sheer volume of ""refugees"" I don't think we should keep allowing them in. We are taking 20,000 over the next five years. The EU now needs to stand up and make other countries ""do their bit"" and take refugees too ! It's NOT an EU problem - they all want to get to the EU - it'll cripple us all if they do and could well change everything we stand for and value - tradition wise and security wise !"	1
Problem is they will go to all the countries them start trying to change them. They will push their religious beliefs on everyone and demand people do what they want. Just like the southerners that keep crossing the u.s. border. Funny how none of the other Muslim countries are trying to help them. Everyone needs to band together to crush the isis vermin and let them stay where the migrants come from.	1
The responsibility to handle the refugees should be divided in accordance to those same nations that caused the crises through their warmongering in the first place. The greater the effort they put into warfare in middle eastern nations, the greater the number they should be required to take in. This should obviously include the US, as most would then be shipped here. We can house them all in DC. maybe they can help us get rid of the terrorists currently occupying that city.	0
Simon, I can see where you are comming from and there is a lot I can agree with you on. I just want to add that if Hungary didn't send the migrants to Germany or put a stop on numbers passing through Hungary by enforcing border controlls nobody would have taken it seriously till to this day. My biggest concern is that according to current estimates only 20-30% of the will get refugee status and those who won't will be asked to return home. I am not sure if you have seen the reaction when people were stopped and asked to register but you could see lots aggression and violence. What will happen when they are encouraged to go home? I can't even imagine their reactions. And will they? The EU is notoriously bad at returning refugees to their country of origin. I am still thinking border control is the way forward but not only in Hungary but all the way along. If we suppose that they can return to their countries after it is safe then refugees must be helped (by the enitre EU) as close to their home as possible. Also it would discourage those who are not running from war to stay at home and dont risks their life. If you cannot protect the border you soon won't be able to protect not even EU citizens but the real refugees who need help. My other problem is that at this stage EU is talking about quotas, migrants and refugees and to be frank we don't even know who is who and have estimated numbers at this point. Why do we have to transport people to Germany and find out there that they are not even refugees then retunr them back? It is not fair on them and not fair on the EU. And a side note..... it would be great to see some balanced reporting in the media as well and not making the situation worse by picking on certain countries like Hungary when to be honest nobody can handle the situation.	1
"Eszter - I agree with you 100%, in the ideal world. But let's say everyone agrees to implement 100% border control at midnight tonight - with the numbers we are seeing, countries in eastern Europe will struggle to give the aid that is needed (even if the refugees were to behave and abide by the law). That is why I said about letting the ones moving get to Germany - so the burden falls on the country, or countries that can handle it, until the UN takes over. As for genuine refugees vs illegal immigrants... that is another reason to pass the problem on to Germany, because eastern Europe couldn't undertake the burden of repatriating the illegals. The only way to fix the problem is stop the flow at source, and let the rest get to somewhere better equipped. Your second concern (about knowing who is who, and where they are) is a major issue for Europe that I feel will come back to haunt Europe. I believe Hungary have already arrested at least one member of ISIS, so how many more have just disappeared - and even without the terrorist threat, how many ""undesirables"" or criminals have taken the opportunity to simply vanish? As I said before the situation descended into a great big cluster fk - compassion is one thing, but it looks like western Europe totally lost it's mind, and didn't think a single thing through."	1
Are there terrorists hidden in migration groups? Likely.	1
This mess is a perfect cover up.	1
ISIS has threatened to flood Europe with half a million migrants from Libya in a 'psychological' attack against the West, it was claimed today. Transcripts of telephone intercepts published in Italy claim to provide evidence that ISIS is threatening to send 500,000 migrants simultaneously out to sea in hundreds of boats in a 'psychological weapon' against Europe if there is military intervention against them in Libya. Many would be at risk of drowning with rescue services unable to cope. But authorities fear that if numbers on this scale arrived, European cities could witness riots.......This was part of a story in an italian newspaper on 18/2/15 and 7 months later it seems to be coming true 😔	1
How many Mexicans were involved in destroying the World Trade Center or bombing the Boston Marathon?	1
"These are not ""refugees"" They are wolves in sheep's clothing. If anything they are economic migrants."	1
"Not to mention that the article obligates them to register ( they present themselves without delay(, while these ""refugees"" resist registration and fingerprinting... I't interesting the media allways ""forget"" ti mention this."	1
Hmmmm... I am getting cross... I have just read that Syria launched air attacks against IS, or whatever they call themselves. My question is WHY haven't Syria formed an ARMY...??? This is an important issue because lots of their young men are running away... WHY are they not in an army...? WHY should they look for a 'better life' in Europe (and the UK) when we had to fight for our way of life, with death and injury affecting our families...??? Now with US and Russia involved, it seems to me that WW3 is approaching... I SUGGEST that Europe (and the UK) accept women, with their children, as refugees. All other people should be regarded as illegal immigrants and sent to Syria, no matter where their origin, to fight in their army to achieve a 'better life' for themselves...	1
If you Check https://www.facebook.com/AngelaMerkel page! It is inundated with Concerns by the German Public and Calls for her to resign! A quiet different picture of What the BBC and the mainstream media gives us of happy Germans welcoming migrants!!! This Propaganda has too STOP right now!!!!	1
And then for all the stupid racists ,or not even, but at least black and white indoctrinated people. ( And this little AmericanTy Royce etc.What do you know about Europe anyway? Study some more! ) Europe and even more America is what it became because of immigrants! But anyway,have a nice life, all of you! And let's hope other ones will find that to!	0
For all those people that could'nt be bothered to vote UKIP at the last election you sow the seed now reap the reward ISLAMIST takeover of europe	1
I'm with you there I live in (born) UK and I will fight for it VOTE UKIP at the next opportunity many whom didn't have fast wished they had The rest have buried their media soaked brsinwashed heads in the sand !!	0
At least Farage understands the problem and says what they all think but are to cowerdly to say out loud. Europe cannot support all these migrants. We will have a mosque on every street corner soon and you know what muslims want for us. Vote UKIP next time but by then it will be to late. We will have an islamic country.	0
Shocker, another UKIP supporter who can neither spell nor use punctuation correctly. Putting the word 'islamist' in capital letters does not make it true. Now crawl back under the rock from whence you came, and leave politics to those with the intellectual capacity to understand it.	1
Sam Lakin what do you call these people that refuse to register and rush police lines to illegally enter a nation? Stupid liberal scum will complain about your benefits being cut to pay for the housing and health care for the invaders. UK is the next Greece	0
Getting fed up with the 'violin' act. 10% are probably genuine unfortunately the rest are after cherry picking a different life. I'd have more compassion if they adhered to the countries laws and complied with them. Why won't people register because they have things to hide. If I travel somewhere abroad I have to comply. This is a world problem. Investment needed in the camps around Syria to give people healthcare and education. We have to be realistic Europe cannot absorb whole countries.	1
The Terrorist are among them. Better have good filters. They hide among the women and children. Invading at will!	0
"I know someone will think this is racist, but why can't they just leave Europe for the Whites? EVERY major race on the planet has their own part of the world, they call home. The Latinos have all of Mexico and Central and South America. The Blacks have most of the Caribbean islands and African countries. The Arabs have most of North Africa and the Arabian Penninsula. The Indian people have South Asia. The ""Asians"" as we call them here, have all of eastern Asia, and the Polynesians have most of the Pacific islands. Why can't the WHITES have one part of the world for themselves? Whites don't flock in hoards to regions where other races are the majority. We need to preserve our culture and our land. Please. Let us have at least ONE continent for ourselves. i don't mind a few, but not so many. Seriously, I visited Copenhagen and felt like I was in the Middle East. This is ridiculous. PLEASE EUROPE, fight to preserve your culture and values. LEAVE EUROPE FOR THE WHITES!"	0
Hungary must respond the same as Israel do to Palestinians....., you know what I mean, without compassion. That's the only way, full stop. They are in Europe to no good, soon European are going to feel it.	1
This is how to create a watercannon damaged crying migrant boy to the mainstream media: http://hiddenlolcdn.com/i/46910.gif	1
Re Syrian Refugess why are these Muslim Rich Arab Countries not taking any? IE: Jordan. Saudi Arabia. Oman. Kuwait. Bahrain. Qatar. U.A.E. Strange don't you think? Is it because the Rulers, King's, Princes of these Rich and Opulent Countries own most of London? Breed world class Race Horses here, own Footbal Clubs, mix with our Royalty ? Who allow their unruly Sons to Race around Londons Knightsbridge in hugely expensive Cars, and get their Rich Fathers to pay their Parking fines? Their Daughters who take over floors at Londons most expensive hotels and are guarded 24/7 by Private Detectives? All very strange. Muslim Countries rich or poor should help fellow Muslims!	1
That's true. Just like Christian countries always help each other. So long as they are the right kind of Christians. And not darkies. And went to a decent school........	0
most of them are not syrian!!!!!	1
#JustineLouise your previous comments are telling me that you must be a very unpleasant human being...	0
Saudi Arabia has a huge refugee camp that can literally fit hundreds of thousands if not millions of people, yet it sits empty. It's all for show. They don't want their own kind, but they'll spend millions building mosques in Germany. If that doesn't prove this spread is intentional and calculated, I don't know what does.	0
I love Europe and it's the reason I detest the EU. Left wing fascism at it's worse. Merkel has caused this ridiculous scenario and then a week later closes her borders. Germany IS the EU and act like dictators to the rest of Europe. It's time Europe got out of this tyranny	0
"Typically English to say. Germany was forced to stop singing ""Deutschland über alles"" but when will the UK be forced to stop singing ""Britannia Rules the Waves""? I mean, ""left-wing fascism"" is an a contradiction - don't you know fascism is ALWAYS right-wing? If anyone is fascist, it's the UK which refuses to cooperate within the EU properly and pretends that it's giving away its OWN money. No, mate, you stole that wealth from your empire and now you pretend its yours. The least you can do is help the rest of Europe with that enormous wealth which you stole. Even your crown jewels were stolen from India!"	0
Haha oh boy. So much garbage written. You won't even acknowledge that liberal fascism exists? :D and please, you want to bring Germany and history into this. Please don't you can never win on that argument. My comment isn't an attack on Germans, just their leader, the self important Queen of Europe, yet you want to attack me because you suspect I'm British :D	1
The stop is temporary due to the Oktoberfest in Munich. The Merkle regime wants to earn millions of euros in revenue from the Oktoberfest and we all know that beer and angry Germans alongside this mob of people will not be a good combination! The temporary border measures are just that alas.	1
It needs to stop now these migrants are flooding through Hungary turned back Bangladeshis last week .... This is not a refugee crisis it's an migrant invasion . Stop the boats at source Turkey needs to step up on this point and stop them .	1
George 85% are single young men ... Refugees fleeing conflict ok but wake up the facts tell a story .	1
George Gilmartin A Japanese bank calculated the cost to the German tax payer of ONE of these people over 12 months and it is in the region of €16,000! The kids are just tools to get benefits and without proper paper work and testing how can a family relationship be proven? The Romanians stopped large mobs of Bangladeshis on the Hungarian border.	0
what is abundantly clear is that the people of the the UK do not see this as a crisis which should be solved by admitting the thousands of migrants kicking down the fences to the Schengen area. I used to be very pro Europe, but the way this issue, and the Greek crisis, have been handled has made me think again. I see little benefit in staying as a member of the EU.	1
No benefit at all unless one works for the corrupt non elected EU institutions	0
Which is where all the failed politicians see themselves. They don't want to see it break up because it is in their personal interests to keep it going	1
All EU countries should close their borders NOW!	0
Yeah nasty Eastern European countries who like to kill other humans because of their ethnic origins...... Let us not forget the 1990s... How can we be surprised.	0
"Today, Germany is committing the biggest mistake in the history of modern Europe. Soon, due to stupidity and helpful Germans at the gates of Europe will arrive 100 million ""refugees"" / immigrant ""/ despair"". What will you do in this situation, it knows Doman Merkel ??? We will oblige EU countries to receive three 10 million refugees ????"	0
Instead of taking out Isis you do this? Consequences are going to be outrageous! Muslim countries should be taking these people! Not the west!	1
European countries should stop accepting Migrants now! It's not about whether they're Muslim or Christian. Some are just using it as an alibi! Their country should take responsibilities over their people! Many European people are also struggling with their lives!	1
"As Croatia collapsed within 1 day, again Hungary has to solve the chaos. Now we must build up the fence till the Slovenian border as we did it at border of Serbia. Croatia is carrying the illegal immigrants to Hungary (as Serbia did it before) - daily more than 10 000 immigrants. Croatia doesn't defend its border, they don't deserve the membership of the EU. That's the Southern Slav mentality. (when they should do something, they don't do anything - as it happened so many times in the history) Hungary is the only country that keeps the rule of Schengen. We register and supply the illegal immigrants. We ensure that there isn't humanitarian catastrophie. The European Union let us again alone. It takes daily 1 billion Hungarian forint but we don't get any support from the EU. As the fence will be ready from Serbia to Slovenia, Hungary closes the border again and nobody will enter to us. Approximately 2000 Hungarian soldiers are building the fence and 3000 police officers look after the order. It would be nice if you reader from England, Germany, France and from all the countries of the world, never forget which country was the only tower against the illegal muslim horde! Don't believe to your press that is constantly crying for the ""refuggess""! They are constantly lying to you day to day! Greetings from Hungary!"	0
The migrants don't want to stay in Croatia even though they were given food and shelter! 20.000 people in 2 days entered a 4 mln country that already has 300.000 unemployed. Are you normal? And they said we were taking away their freedom to move and they are moving towards Slovenia and Hungary. Take a look at our economy and notice we can't handle this without any help from EU. Croatia still feels the bitter part of the economy crisis, we can't help anyone.	1
Oh god, than that's the solution that you transport them from Zagreb to Hungary? How wide is the Slovenian border from Zagreb? Awfull what are you doing. Question: what will you do when the fence will be ready at the border and we close it? Than? What will you do? Shame on you and your country!	0
No, we don't think that Hungary is expert in anything, except in building fences and spreading xenophobia. The problem originated from the lack of proper control at border crossing between Turkey and Greece. When the migrants have entered the EU there, it is only a matter of time when will they end where they want and there is no way to get them back to Syria now. Army and fences will solve nothing. Only a plan on the EU level with the exact quotas for each country can solve the problem. Nationalism, racism, and widespread xenophobia, as promoted by PM Orban will make things only worst.	0
Your answer is according to the typical liberal mainstream. Just wait for other's help but doing nothing. Oh yes, we can say you are politically correct, Merkel and the other liberals will applaud for you. Nice! Just forget 1 thing: Croatia shoulnd't check there border? Why do you let come in to the EU the illegal immigrants without any controll? Or do you think that you haven't any responsibilty? Wake up!	1
Than they must stop the smuggling what they are constantly doing! If the countries where the illegal immigrants movements happen now, make physical barriers than they can't enter into the EU. Paralell the greek navy should stop the immigrants on the see and defend the Schengen border. If all the countries are only waiting for something than this invasion won't stop which can be easily the end of Europe. That's all.	1
How is this for a plan.. since Merkel was so keen to help.. how about all of europe agree to give them free passage to germany, and then build one huge fking wall right round the border, so they can't get out again. :)	0
Simon Bellenie start killing them now	0
Wow am I watching the BBC? Dateline London someone actually going off script and giving a sensible view not the usual Pravda left wing opinion and he's also got the gaul to stay calm as they try to shout him down. My he even put Gavin Esler in his place by pointing out the emotive language used when introducing the refugee crisis topic. If this continues I might even start watching it again regularly, no get real I know in my heart it won't change and all the good work done by the guy from Conservative Home will be forgotten.	1
Quite often we have to pay the price for other people's stupid decisions. I see no due diligence being demonstrated by Merkel or the EU parliamentarian aristocrats. The only due diligence now is for EU countries to reinstate passport control at their borders. There is a big difference between fear and reasonable caution.	0
"Dear BBC, it's not ""migrants"", it's REFUGEES. Migrants are people who willingly enter a country, these people are FLEEING from war, even if they cross borders in the process. Stop slurring the terminology for Pete's sake..."	1
Don't be so naive. Even the BBC is now making it clear that only about a third are genuine refugees from Syria. The rest are economic migrants jumping the queue by using violent tactics.	1
Paula Robinson completely agree with you! Those of you who are really smart writing on facebook, come and see what is goning on on the hungarian borders. When they are throwing away tons of foods and water offered them and paid by OUR money. taking all fruits from our farmers yards like mantis. 85% of these poeple are NOT refugees! Refugees are and were always welcomed in Hungary. Rfugees are humble and thankful. They obey the law. I wonder how many of you seen that they used their kids as human shield whe the police hold them up. They THROW across the fence their own children for god's sake!	1
Dear Martina - they are migrants they moment they leave a safe country. True enough the ones that are in countries that border syria are refugees, but when you start marching across europe demanding entry into whichever country best suits your ambitions, you turn YOURSELF into an economic migrant. Could anyone actually give me a justification for continually arguing a point that has been explained to you time and time again? All these posts on here turn out the same way - the same trolls pushing the same message, yet never able to answer a simple question. Yes Egan and Andry, this directly applies to you. Given that the argument from them being called migrants is clear, what is the argument for them being called refugees when they leave a bordering country?	1
Actually, they're a mix of both, hence why they recently started using both terms in their news broadcasts. You need your head checking if you believe that they're all refugees, and the same can be said if you think they're all migrants.	1
A refugee must ask for asylum in the first country where there is peace. If they continue to migrate to other countries, not having a valid travel document, crossing borders in fields rather than the official way, they become illegal migrants and according to laws should be treated that way and deported. Very simple. Tell me where there is war all the way from Turkey to Germany, Sweden, UK? You might say Kosovo, perhaps. Other than that there is no conflict and no reason not to ask for asylum. That being said - not only they are they illegal migrants but illegal economical migrants. Those who really need help of any kind are not these, but those who suffer in kemps in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and even Egypt.	1
What is wrong with you? They are illegal immigrants and should be sent home. Winston Churchill would be turning in disgust with this situation. Shame on you.	0
"For Europeans asking where the women (refugees) are? Most of those young men are here to ""breed"" with your women and take over. That's what they did in each country they colonised. In ""Islamic"" Sharia a Muslim man is allowed to marry Christian & Jewish women and enslave ""athiest"" women to ""breed"" and bring in more Muslim offspring to the world, but a Muslim woman would be an adultress to marry a non-muslim - because a woman (and children) will be under the leadership of the husband, which in this case poses more than one ""Islamic"" dilemma. Muslims led many invasion in the past but they no longer need armes to invade Europe. They just need an army of young men to ""entre"" Europe and that will be it. Next thing ""your women"" will be here fighting their battles and before you know it, they are citizens and their offspring are European by birth. This is not a far future. It takes - with the other tactics employed - just one generation."	1
And they breed like grasshoppers.. Bye bye Europe.	1
After the damage to its European and international image during the Greek financial crisis negotiations debacle Angel Merkel is 'jumping the gun' and opening the gates to 'floods of people' looking for government hand-outs who have no (or little) hope of finding work in Germany or are prepared (or able) to integrate themselves into European society .... Hungary should be commended for showing people that its laws must be respected and that it is absurd to claim to be a 'refugee' and simultaneuosly 'force' (battling police, even if unarmed) your way into another country ... the real refugees from the Syrian civil war are in the refugee camps of Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey and deserve all the help necessary to provide them with the basic necessities of life and a chance to immigrate to another country by LEGAL immigration or return to their own country once the fighting has stopped and international assistance in rebuilding that country should be generously provided ... not least by the countries who took advantage of Syria's domestic problems (to reduce pressure on Israel to make peace with the Palestinians) and by their meddling (sending mercenaries) prolonged the fighting and caused many civilian deaths and most of the refugee problem ...	1
They only show snippets on TV, leading you to believe it's all about the women and kids. Wrong! This migrant situation is 75 % young men, going to Europe with a purpose in mind. They threw in a few woman and kids to make it look better. They were suppose to stop at the borders to have their papers checked, lots of them burned their passports. They threw the food they were given to the ground. These are Not refugees. These are Migrants intent on taking Europe. Germany should have never offered refuge to the mass exodus. All borders should be shut. How many Isis are in this group? The countries should only keep the women and kids plus the fathers, all the young men should be returned. Not that many Syrians but lots of other countries that are not even involved in fighting.	1
Hy. I am a hungarian and please, lets clear something. Hungary receive the migrants for months (4000-11 000 people per day). We give them water, food (which they dash against our policemans), blankets, clothes, medicines, toys. We also showed the disney tale for the kids in the East-Railway Station. Many hungarian voluntaries and policemans help them, but unfortunately nobody see these pictures in west. Yes, the government built a fence, because the migrants arrived ILLEGAL through the GREEN BORDER. The authorities could’t check them and catch the smugglers. Besides, the migrants trampled down the fieldlands, so they caused serious damages for the farmers. Please, don’t forget, the registration points are still OPEN. However, the migrants don’t want register. They don’t give fingerprint and many of them throw away their papers. They would like to go Germany immediately without any papers and become angry when they have to wait a few hours (or a day) for the next train. This situation cause the most conflicts with the police. Greece, Italy, Croatia don’t try register the migrants (maybe Slovenia do something). Now, IT IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. Hungary is the single country, which keep the schengen’ s rules. This is our responsibility. Currently, Croatia transport thousands of migrants with buses to the hungarian border. Yes, we take over them. We need to work TOGETHER. Please, stop blame Hungary for everything. Thank you. :)	1
This is the beginning of the end for Europe. Farewell old friend. I have loved traveling and experiencing your rich culture - now it's terminally ill, and the cancer is spreading fast.	1
every soldier who died for our country has obviously died for no reason now your letting immigrants in... yet they wont take the food and water given at the border till they are allowed in our country!!! they musnt be that bad if they wont accept it!!! OPEN YOUR EYES AND REALISE THEY HAVE DONE ALL THIS ON PURPOSE!!! TO RULE ENGLAND AND MAKE IT THEIR COUNTRY...Stop bieng fkn Stupid and get some guts like SLOVAKIA HAVE!!!!!!!	0
Can't blame some of EU countries some are just recovering from war and money crisis & now they have migrants who rather take chances to other country rather than fight for their homeland . Sad situation.	1
It is an ILLEGAL OCCUPATION/INVASION CRISIS..	1
Helene you're naive to think that. They won't be going back ever! That's not being a refugee!	1
Oh deary me Helena. Wake up. It is an invasion. Hope you are looking forward to 1 million of these lovely folks coming to your country. They will not assimilate, they will not respect your democracy nor your rule of law. They will demand everything and give nothing back in retun. Germany once again sends Europe in crisis. How many times is that?	1
The EU is bringing Europe to the brink. The Union is designed to maintain peace in Europe....but it's policy of forced diversity is starting to tear the continent apart. Only a small percentage of those traveling to the west are Syrian...and only a percentage of those are families. Just because Germany, France, Sweden, Belgium, Holland and Britain wishes to commit cultural and ethnic suicide by allowing uncontrolled numbers of non-White, non-Christian people in to their country....doesn't mean the rest of Europe has to. I hope we are seeing the end of this Marxist federal nightmare that we are being forced into....but I see dark times ahead!!	1
My heart aches for Europe and what's to come to our land. These people are 500 years behind in so many things and they WILL bring that mentality to us. ISLAM is vile, ISLAM is violent, ISLAM is antifeminist, homophobic, and just filthy. GO AWAY!	0
I can't understand why Europe is breaking its neck to take in these migrants you know nothing about them they are going unchecked you have no idea who's coming in ! Why are you all rushing to help these people Muslins hate us our way of life and culture if the situation was reversed these people would do NOTHING for us there are other nationalities in there these should be sent straight back to where they came from WAKE UP EUROPE seal the border end of story !!!these people come here throwing their weight around making demands Europe owes them NOTHING ! And all these fit men should be send back and be fighting for their own country ! Having just watched The Sunday Politics show Heidi Alexander of Labour said we should be taking thousands more Muslims what planet is she living on ??? The UK is FULL we can't even house our present population schools and hospitals are bursting at the seams and this woman makes these stupid remarks ! But then I guess she'd rather house Muslims than her fellow citizens !	0
I agree with the TY persons comment. You are smarter then that aren't you?We don't want them here, Cultures of different backrounds really don't work that is why country's are so very different	0
Daily Mail (London) reports that a top Iman has told Muslims to use the migrant crisis to breed with European citizens and 'conquer their countries'. Sheikh Muhammad Ayed gave the speech at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem claiming Europe was only welcoming refugees as a new source of labour. He said Europe was facing a demographic disaster and urged Muslims to have children with westerners so they could 'trample them underfoot, Allah willing.' Birth rates are far higher in the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, which is where most migrants are coming from.The notion of using mass migration as a form of stealth jihad is outlined in the Koran, which states, 'And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah will find on the earth many locations and abundance.' To move to a new land in order to bring Islam is considered a meritorious GERMANY TODAY REVERSES WHAT MARTEL HAS WON FOR EUROPE. The Battle of Tours 1356, was fought on October 10, 732 between forces under the Frankish leader Charles Martel and a massive invading Islamic army led by Emir Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi Abd al Rahman, near the city of Tours, France. During the battle, the Franks defeated the Islamic army and Emir Abd er Rahman was killed. This battle stopped the northward advance of Islam from the Iberian peninsula, and is considered by most historians to be of macrohistorical importance, in that it halted the Islamic conquests, and preserved Christianity as the controlling faith in Europe, during a period in which Islam was overrunning the remains of the old Roman and Persian Empires. Now while ISIS is overrunning Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya, Germany is opening its borders to Syrians, and thereby what Charles Martel achieved for Europe has been made fruitless. These migrants cannot be compared to WWII refugees, for they were Europeans and they had no hidden agenda either to propagate their religion or to indulge in terrorist activities, as Atta & Co., did on 9/11 after enjoying everything in the West.	1
And you believe the Daily Mail (fail) your either really stupid or just born dumb .	0
We are under siege, and they are invading fast. Soon they will be all over Europe. They must be stopped and sent back.	0
Close borders, send the ones already here back then get out of EU. If not the white European will soon b a memory, the only difference will be they will be fighting here instead. Wait tho, maybe the cowards will run back to Syria then!	0
We need to put electric fences around ourselves. They won't want to cross 240 volts of electric fencing x	1
I think they should go back to their country and fiat like they are doing to the Hungarians. I am sorry , but what I have see is man using children as shields or women, they want to get to Germany to destabilizes the Europeans country . They do not want to be fingerprint, or for that matter haven prove papers. This is to bad for all of them , but so far they have show destruction on there pat .	1
Here's a thought... why don't those countries gather an army and go in there and clean that place up? Why does it always have to be the U.S. to police the world?	1
"this is the beginning of the end of the EU. At least I have options - but all of these ""softly softly"" left wing white apologists have not really thought this through, have they..."	1
Everyone in Europe knows this is the end of our customs, religions, way of life. I can see right wing parties being voted in next, unless it's too late already.	1
Statement from ISIS early 2015 'we will send thousands of fighters in boats to Europe and you will take them in'.....4 months later and what's happening???	1
Instead of letting all these refugees in, why don't we (all european nations, NATO ect) send a lot of troops in to eradicate ISIS. Surely in the long term this is the best possible solution. The one time we have a genuine humanitarian reason to get troops on the ground and because there is no financial benefit no one is interested, we just prat about with our toy drones and a few bomb drops slowly picking them off and its not working!!!	1
Deirdre Wolf Slater check the news before you say something 20-30% of them are refugees only most of them came from countries where there is no war and pass through safe countries where there is no war. Not hating outsiders but want to know who is who. Why is that an inhumane sin? Would you let strangers in your own house who won't tell you who they are? I think you are the one smoking something funny.....	0
Turn them back and let the surrounding, very wealthy, Muslim countries take care of their own.	0
Well, that was predictable. How long did it take for immigrants to destabilise europe. Objective achieved.	1
"Canada has to be careful when receiving them. They have all destroyed their id documents so that they can be accepted as refugees. Don't press our government too much on this issue. ""Nobody is illegal "" is not a good slogan."	1
The crisis can be easily resolved. First Europe is not responsible for it, secon those from Syria should apply for political asylum and register and lastly send the rest back. It is so simple many of these people created their own crisis and put their families in danger.	1
It will all end in tears if not another war between Europeam countries The World must act and act soon against ISIS and Syrian forces destroying their homeland	1
Seems more like some kind of invasion - so many military aged young men in those groups than a real refugee movement..	1
Also, does it seem a bit odd that hundreds of thousands of migrants are coming at the same time? Was there an announcement made in all the refugee camps to leave at once? It appears to be a little bit of a conspiracy.	1
First of all these people are not migrants.....they are missionaries of you know who...! It's quite simple.....don't let anyone enter in their respective country. There are so many humanitarian grounds to think about......with in few days of entering the refugees hosted ISIS flags in Germany. So decide it for your self...are they refugees or part of a new Jihad planed by ISIS. (The best way to get penetration in Europe)	1
Its Simple. the EU should tell Arabs if possible force them to take in the Refugees. then European countries can assist the middle eastern Refugees Camps financially and also provide aids for them so this desperate men and women wont be risking their lives in coming to Europe. also Europe should build boarders and make Hungarian Prime Minister the Head of the EU cause he is the only one with common sense on how to handle the migrants and refugees crisis	1
Teargas is your idea of 'common sense'? Interesting. I don't want any leader who pummels small children with teargas Head of Anything, let alone the EU.	1
We should have a pm with some guts. What have we got David Cameron and a loony left for labour. Pity there isn't anyone like Churchill he said Muslims were like rabid dogs. Why can't they just say NO we don't want anymore. Lets make Britain great again and not just a dumping ground. Lets start looking after our own	0
Europe needs to set a precedent of strong borders otherwise everyone all over the world will start invading Europe just because they can.	1
These are economic migrants. They go wherever they want to go (Germany) without permission or respecting the law even though they were already safe in Turkey.	0
It's about time we saw the whole story, The latest reporting has been nothing less than a media campaign to make us feel sorry for a mob heading our way. You very rarely show anything but the kids crying, We can go to other news agencies and what you see is a mob of 18-30 year old men screaming and battering Hungarian police if they don't get what they want. Do you really think we are stupid. Go on any website most people don't want any of them here. We have enough of our own problems. We do not want to become a Muslim country, Mrs Merkal says she wants them then let her have them all. Then close our borders .	1
All those refugees are selfish and primitive ppl.....how they will adjust to European culture...because their don't want.	0
Bloody Useless Since it Came about Should have Stayed the way we Were Oh But MPs and Governments know Better DONT THINK SO,,,Another Bloody Mess under European Rule..	1
shoot them all, done!!! let the communists solve the problem!!! coz i believe that these people wont stop, sooner or later, Germany will have to use guns	0
The border must be closed now as we don't won't anymore migrants . As for the Tory get out of the EU and think of our people . We should be thinking of the ex service and the homeless with children . As they need a safe place to live in instead of sleeping in the streets etc. So open your eyes for once.	1
Push them into Russia. I don't see all these people fleeing east. Why west? They hate our culture anyway.	1
I just cannot understand why any Adult would bring any child to the front of any war zone? And that's what this issue is becoming!!	1
Serbian government wants to look good in pictures as the EU decides whether they should join it or not...	1
It i unacceptable that illegal aliens would have free access across Europe. Imagine if it was the case across India, China, Russia, even the USA. The military, the national guard, the border police would be summoned to protect national frontiers and citizens against any type of invasion, no matter the reason and/or excuse behind it.	0
If Islamic countries turn them away for being Muslim why on earth are we accept this barbaric violent religion into our country. Send them all back its the only way to protect us all	0
Obama ,NATO,Israel & Saudis start this mess Funding the Syrian Rebels aka Al Qaeda / ISIS with Money & Weapons trying to over throw Bashar al-Assad and kill all the Syrian Christians. Obama these Leaders must be Charge for War Crimes	1

Why do you keep calling its something its not --Is everyone there in the BBC that uneducated ? They are refugees !!-They are entering illegally and were does it stop ?	0
People the other side of the world have the right attitude to the migrants .

Al-Gadhafi said. „If Jesus were alive when Muhammad was sent, he would have followed him.

Paul Raisbeck, you are perfectly right, but you know EU without borders concept was a product of some insane mind !

Far too many. After getting what they want, will they want their families to join them? Why aren't they asking for refuge in a Muslim country! Frightening. Britain has its own problems - where are we going to put thousands more?	1
Deirdre Wolf Slater so you prefer your own country's policemen standing there being attacked for hours by stones and getting injured while people who won't respect your law demand that you let them in on their terms? Meanwhile migrants using their children as huma shields and throwing them over the wall? No refugee has a right to attack police. They have duties as well and they gave to respect the law of the country they seek asylum.	0

Vedran Iskra unlike Hungary Croatia does that humane? Really? Do it for months without transferring them back to Hungary and remain humane. You simply cannot compare months to days! And nobody does it humane, nor Austria neither Germany, they had over 300 arsen attackes on refugee camps this year only. By the way your prime minister sad that you are prepared for dealing with it unlikely Hungary and your system collapsed after 1 day!!! Well done Mr Milanovic for making a fool of yourself!!!! And actually there is no law against building fences, I checked it. Otherwise the fence in Calais would be brought down too....

I never knew that Europeans were still so nationalistic. I would have thought that the failed policies based in xenophobia that led your continent into two world wars would have created in you at least a modicum of xenophilia. What a shame. By the way these are refugees, not migrants.	1

Funny how once the response from the public doesn't match the BBC'S line of we must allow these invaders into Europe they stop HYS on future news propaganda from this supposedly neutral irganisation.	1
The BBC are becoming traitors , liars and false producers of news. I am getting very angry. Of all the photos of the ranks of young males they still find the obligatory woman and child to lie to the people about the true nature of the migrants. Germanys own figures show almost 80% illegal immigrants. This army of young aggresssive males engulfing europe is being ignored. Why bother with visas and borders if germany says its ok to allow in millions of people with no checks or controls. It is the end of europe.	0

What happens when they get to Europe? Denmark, for example: Every year 29% of asylum seekers commit a crime. 34.5% of rapes are committed by muslims, despite being 4% of the population. 28% of prison inmates are muslim. After 4 years, 87% of syrians are unemployed. 9 groups are more criminal than the average. 8 of them are muslim. Even corrected for socio-economics. So in reality it is much worse. Overall more than half of all non-western immigrants are on welfare. Even counting those who have been here for decades. Somalis have an unemployoment rate of over 80% In Sweden, rapes are up 1500%. But don't worry, not being called racist is preferable to accepting all of this.	1
we can start shooting them	0
Why do they so desperately want to pass on to Germany? Surely anywhere is better a war torn country so be happy with that instead of causing mayhem and disruption.	0

"Why are these migrants above following the process and procedures? Where are the controls to ensure proper following of these regulations? Why do these migrants get to demand where they can ""settle?"" I understand that some are fleeing; however, most are looking for a better life from their refugee camps in Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, etc. But there is an order and process that they need to understand and follow. If that basic concept is not understood, then they are going to have a hard time settling anywhere. Demanding to enter, not registering, throwing rubbish everywhere, damaging property, fighting, protesting, going on a hunger strike, etc. is not going to help their situation. Act a little bit more respectful and humble, then maybe people would be more willing to assist."	1
If this lot get in we won't even have to fire a shot to lose our country!! They will not integrate, speak our language, learn our customs and creeds. They will congregate in their ghettos and stare in a surly aggressive and threatening manner at us in our own country. We might as well kiss our country goodbye. Get REAL people.	0

Countries like Germany and Austria that are the goal of the migrants need to stop taking them and tell them to go back, send back those already there. Other countries taking them in need to do the same. They will overwhelm the social services of those countries.	0
"For Europeans asking why rich Arab countries won't take Muslim refugees? First those Arab states are rich by means of modern slavery (Kafil system), they cannot let people in just to help them. Secondly, Muslim slit each others' throats over different interpretation of Islam. Thirdly, although Muslims have never been friends with each other, they become one Umma (nation) when it comes to aggression against Kufar (infidels); Islamic mass migration (hijra) has always worked well to transform great civilisations into poor retarded nations - BUT it is still a "" victory for Islam"", so why take them in?"	0
If they are really refugees, why don't any of them wish to stay in Croatia or Slovenia? Sure we are not as wealthy but we are stable, secure and peaceful. This is where these people turn from refugees to economic migrants.	1

The images are disturbing; but the media can distort, slant and twist stories. Europe has a crisis in its hands. It's easy for all of us in the outside world to judge and make decisions, sitting on a sofa, in front of a TV. In fact, only the countries directly affected by these events, know what they can handle. How are they going provide food, clothes, schooling and medical care to these many people? What puzzles me the most is why the wealthy Arab countries aren't helping and offering to take in these people	1
This is intolerable. Do not people realise that these people have been raised to believe that Jesus, though the virgin-born messiah, was not one-third of god? Is it not absolutely clear that this is no more or less than a satanic attempt to infiltrate our theological colleges, eventually causing a bewildered population to read their Bibles searching for the bit where Jesus says he is god and has come to die for our sins and NOT FINDING IT? This will clearly bring the end of civilisation as we know it. And what is more, some of these people are slightly browner than proper folk.	0

Muslims are convinced of the perfection contained in their religion that encompasses all the aspects of life and hold Christians and Jews as inferior, imperfect believers. That feeling of superiority is not confirmed by the kind of life they live in Europe. This creates massive frustration, hostility towards their European hosts and a reaction of becoming even more radical. The Muslims of Europe are generally against integration not to speak of assimilation. There might be a few exceptions but these confirm the general rule: Muslims do not approve of the Western World.	0

Dear BBC News For that crisis Croatia is not guilty... agreement was that Croatia can be transit country, everyone around us agree. What Hungary, Slovenia and Austria done? Close border... what Hungary and Slovenia expect of our Prime Minister Milanovic and of Croatia? To be fools for them?... They angry because we partially close our border but they close their borders with wire and walls! They can close but we can't!!!!!! What the hell they were thinking? Croatia can't handle with hundreds of thousands refugees, we can't hold them here because they want to go on north... Most of Croatians don't have something to eat but we help as much as we can. So... push Slovenia, Austria and Hungary to open their borders and let refugees to go where they want. They just can't stuck in Croatia. If no one want them, why they think that refugees can and must stay in Croatia!!!!!!!! Are we again become someone else's fool? If countries around us will close their borders for real, we also will close our Croatian border.	1
We maybe not the best country but we are not stupid! You said rule of EU! Are the closing border with wire by the rule of EU? You forgot that Hungary were transit country and when you close your border and refugees start to come here that all other states close border also!!!! That is not mocking of Croatia? You are mocking with all of us when you close your border. I admire you for that action because I understand why but why you expect of Croatia to do somsone else's job.... Agree was - Croatia transit country! All you around suddenly close your border. Are you register all of them? We can handle with maybe thousands per day not with ten thousand per day. Many of refugees don't want to register and now what? The same news we read from Hungary and now we are guilty? Why? Why you close your border and we can't? Are you all aware that we have 300 thousands of unemployed, many thousands who work and not receive a sallary, many homeless and now, in a great european spirit you all expect of us to take care of hundreds of thousands refugees while you made a fun of us with your closed border???? Refugees don't want to stay and don't want to register (we register them first day but after no one wants to register), they want to go north!	1
"Eszter Bedo Put aside economy and what ours politicians talking, every country has that problem... We all know that this kind of refugees travel throught the countries just like that... even german chancellor knows that.... I'm or we are not contradicting - You forgot Eszter that before you close border there were agreement that Croatia will be transit country ( are we?) and that you all the time untill you close yor border WERE TRANSIT, no one around you made a problem to you for refugees because we heard all kind of news from Hungary, good and bad, register and not register - but, I repeat - you were transit all the time. Croatia is not in the same situation - we are surounded with countries who close border and not allow refugee crossing... EU just can't expect of us to do job what we all had to do from the beginning and we can't accumulate refugees in Croatia because suddenly all of you find out that is a bit too much of them. I'm contradicting? Europe is thought to cheat Croatia again and turn Croatia into a ""collection center for refugees"" - because what else will mean close all borders around us and suddenly the EU rule - no new corridors? You forgot - Hungary had open coridor during the long period before closing border!!!! I have a right not to be contradicting because I'm not - I have the righ to be very angry. Solution for a problem is - all states can open border and one rute can go through Hungary, one through Croatia... or we all can help Greece to close land and sea borders or.... there is many solution but no will. Eszter... Hungary as a country is a great, I really have nothing against you and I just even admire border act you done but this just not right toward Croatia.... We are also knows read and listen when foreign politicians or common people talk and we know add up 2+2... Closed border around us, EU rule - no new refugee coridor... we must be stupid enough to not figured out what that all mean! And after all that what I wrote now, I still respect you country and you and one day maybe we can drink coffee somewhere... but do you all respect my country?"	1

Europe just need to unite and end the migrant influx.	1
Wow. I didn't realize the UK was so ethnocentric, xenophobic, bigoted, racist and paranoid! Just look at these comments. It's amazing!	0
kind of amazing that you seem able to make those kind of judgements on people you don''t know, who happen to be discussing issues you know nothing about (namely the UK) - using a language you clearly don't understand. Or were you being ironic when you called responders bigoted? Coz you know that you have displayed an astonishing level of disregard for the opinions of others... which means I can quite rightly call YOU a bigot.	0
And again, sorry, but were you trying to be ironic making judgements on us, when your country has such a great record on race relations... pot and kettle perhaps? Now who was being xenophobic again? surely not the person displaying their prejudices towards people from the UK... Just delete your post and go away - or better still, go pressure your own people to do something about the situation.	1
how can there be tensions over how to deal with migrants-----STOP them from coming to your countries --period.	0
The EU has no real plan for this crisis, what annoys me the most is if someone is a genuine refugee they would seek asylum in the first EU Union country and that's Greece. Sure most have an idea in mind to get to Germany as the 'ideal' country to settle in, unfortunately this can be interpreted as an 'economic refugee/migrant'. We need to ask, what's really going on.	1
They're just destabilizing Europe and something must be done even if is by force problem is all the bleeding hearts will never let it happen	1
I have no compassion for these ppl there told that the country full but there pushing in other ways. They dont respect our rules that a good enough reasion not to let them in. Border control should use tear gas more often	0
No way, never would've guessed that! Ship the economical immigrants back home so they too can create a civilised county of their own. However it will take a millennia!	0
Maria Szpunar the reason were talking about Muslims at all really is that they have just forced their way half way up Europe against any international law , they come from war torn areas, we have seen them fighting in the streets with police and rioting , we have seen the Islamic flag flown in Germany again when the Syrian Migrants were fighting with German police, we have seen them fighting in the streets of Europe against the afgans a culture clash there , this is in the space of a week, what your seeing is an invasion of Europe nothing less, by who? Refugees, no to be a refugee you have to stop at the first safe country and seek asylum that would have been Greece or Italy.if you proceed you are a migrant and if you have not got papers , passports or any id you are an illegal migrant, however as Ty Royce Weldon says they are the single greatest threat that the western world have 9/11 to remind you in your country, brits killed on a beach in Tunsia recently bombings and be headings, As you say there is bad in each culture very true but this lot rank in top place for total disregard to life did I mention the use of chemical weapons , If this were America I am sure the Americans would want to vet these people before taking them into their country, but in fact they are better to remain in their own cultural land and should really be taken in by other Mislim countries and not be given out handouts and maps to the promised land they already have it its called Syria and as we see all these pictures of a males forcing their way up Europe like a riot mob when ever stopped and asked for ID , they should be fighting for their home land to forge a future for their families , a great majority of these peope need sending back to a safe area and if refugee? go through the right international procedures .but this is just plain lawlessness.	0
Thanks for Germany and Angela Merkel who invited them!!!! And after they pushing every europian countries to change them identity culture....	1
Romania is not on their way, so stay out, you're not welcome here as well! They don't want to come to Romania and Brussels can't force these illegal people to settle in a country where they don't want to go. So take them and integrate , good luck	0
We're bordering on a third world war thanks this open door policy. Islam and Angela Merkel are loving this	1
Aren't there 3 million tents set up in Saudi Arabia and they aren't being used by Muslim refugees. I expect there isn't welfare there? Europe will have to make a stand soon because the tax payers will not stand the strain of the welfare bill.	1
These people need to go back to their country and fight for their country. This is more like an invasion. These people are not thankful for the help they are receiving and they will not adopt their host country culture so they need to go back home or be considered an invasion.	0
they should make a new country in the middle of afghanastan and leave these so called refugees there its not Europe problem or they can move to antartica	0

yes because our NHS is ruined now	1
Yes for the most umpteenth time. Why is it that the Daily Mail actually supports the Conservatives when they should know that they are not going to do anything?	1
of course they should, the sooner the better. then perhaps people born in this country who are on the housing list won't keep being pushed to the back of the queue by all the immigrants.	1
The majority of this country would prefer to know what the true figures for immigration are, not this politically correct way of counting called 'net migration'. And why do the media keep on about the polish. We need to know about all the others that enter this country. The government ram green issues down our throats. If they were serious about green issues, they would do what is necessary - tackle the population issue. People = pollution.	1
can't really see how the UK can afford to take any more in..both the NHS and education systems are on their knees! And as for it's ecomony.....well, that's another story!	1
It's not only NHS and education, it's things that people/government do not think of such as roads, water supply, electricity, extra pollution, crime, and also the dilution of our own culture and identity.	1

I think you will find most Britons aren't opposed to anyone of any race, creed or colour coming here to work, study, and contribute. What people are opposed to is those whom come to simply claim benefits, or worse. It does happen, in a very large way, and it MUST STOP !	1

Training more British students into becoming doctors and nurses instead of driving them into debt is the way forward, instead of importing fakirs from Eastern Europe and the third world (and cannot speak English) on the cheap.	1
but what about the british born citizens, we must be given top priority above other european immigrants,	1
@Parthiben Coopamah!,you are throwing false accusations, speaking without evidence and making generalizations which is not logical!, there might be some who do not speak english well, but generally those who came from third world; they should speak English well to practice medicine in UK, they have to get a required score(which is 7) in IELTS test to practice medicine in UK, which is a very difficult academic English test, and guess what?! i have seen many native English speakers(even University posgraduate students) they got low scores in that test! so it's a test more than English to assess their skills! Finally being born in Britian doesnot give you the credit that you are the smartest person in this world! who gets a job or training, or postgraduate studying or whatever it's by competition!!!	1
i will get the training ,because i am british citizen by birth,london,uk,national health insurance number card,national insurance number card,i voted in england,i got priority over eastern european immigrants,to conclude	0
What are those EU invaders doing here in the first place, evading tax and sucking this country dry?	1
Britain does not need to be part of the EU communist police state.	1
my view if you are not born here you have the right to nothing, if you want to live here or visit you shouldn't be allowed in unless you can prove you have health insurance enough cash to but a home outright and enough cash to sustain your lifestyle for at the very least 3 years. so that would mean any person coming here would know from the outset come here mould with us work hard become english, if not stay where you are.	1
Excuse me? ^ why should we pay to keep the world's work-shy? We are like a honey-pot to the lazy and attract parasites.	1
The sooner we are out of Europe the better, if the beaurocrats of Brussels are so concerned about paying benefits to all and sundry who have no intention of working for them, let them stay in brussels and be paid by the overpaid EU ministers. They will soon change their tune and mind their own business about what we do in the UK.	1
It feels like we are being raped by europe. What else can they possibly take from us? I'd love to know how many other countries obey all their commands, because it seems to me like the UK is the soft touch who can be bullied into anything, so we are at the receiving end of all their nonsense!!!	1

What the hell has that judge been takin?? This is a joke!!	1
wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong.................judge needs assessing for suitability to make sensible decisions - a 12 year old girl now has a life sentence........ I am ASHAMED to be part of the same species!!!!!!!!!	1
"It would ""breech his human rights"" - so change the law you morons!!"	0
Absolutely ridiculous decision...sickening	1
didnt I hear on tv the government was going to revise all of these human rights laws?seems to everyone the victim has none,time for the so called prime minister to either get out of power,or he does what he says.Im so sorry for the young victim.surely sending him back to his own country is better punishment	1
Sorry but this judge needs stringing up from the nearest available lamppost	0
Absouute disgrace the man needs hung this country is a disgrace	0
Like the DM needed an excuse for refugee bashing.	1
When will this country ever learn? He should be sent back to his own country as soon as his sentence has been served!	1
The JUDGE needs to GO!	1
hang the judge after hanging the refugee	0
The bloody UK Law stinks and so does theirt incorporate Human rights they agree to some cases do not deserve them and this is ONE FOR SURE	0
How the hell did this guy get to be allowed to visit here or his family live here we want to see his face. Judge wonder what you feel about your own children and grandchildren/ I know what I would fee like doing if the father. Judge we want you to explain yourself and be made to go. DV T May what are you doing about this.	1
judges are to scared of upsetting the european court of human rights easyer to upset the british people if he was back home he would be dead for doing this here he will be in the cushyest prison untill hes released with a furnished home and a new id and a british passport theres a very simple solution kick them all out	0
Makes you proud of our legal system. Plenty wrong with a country whose judges hjave no sense of reality.	1
take him in a room with a sharp knife and peel his skin off very very slowly,when hes done do the same to the judge	0
Its not the judges fault, its the lawmakers fault.	1
Invaders. And these stupid governments just let them do it while giving you hassle at the airport over minor things. Civil war is imminent.	0
INVADERS! right,like a european conquers in Africa,Latin América and Asia hundred years ago.....	0
There will be no civil war, too many feminised beta males who are afraid of being called names.	0
They are not migrants. Those young men are mercenaries.	1
Shoow Tiime did you forget about the Islamic invaders that got to those countries long before the white Europeans and introduced slavery to those continents?? Learn your history........the full history and not just the selective bad bits about the devil white man.	0
if you are going to report this then please use the correct term, ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS	0
Leaving their woman and children behind to their own fate as they come to europe. How do the one world lefties debate that ine when crying about the poor immigrants	0
Before their country was destabilised in the name of Western democracy these occurences weren't there. The result of putting your nose where it don't belong	1
Nia ...but hillary the witch was involved ! She & mama Merkel are the worst women in history !	0
We in Europe no longer feel safe and the governments we are paying huge taxes to have broken their contracts with their people. They do not protect us.	1
You telling me with all the technology radar weapons etc that these invaders cant be dealt with ? Seriously ..... Dread to think what next 5 years are going to bring for civilised society.	0
And it was these invaders who not so long ago gang raped a woman in front of her husband. My advice is: Stay away from Italy.	0
An eye for an eye? Very civilized!	1
What are you smoking	1
I smoke wheat but not as strong as the one that you smoke because i can understand your stage is higher	1

Until the governments start getting tough and immediately deport them instead of pampering them they will keep coming!	0
Boot them out/turn the boats away : by all necessary means!.	0
3000 illegal male working age migrants. I wonder where the women and children are...	1
The quicker Britain out of the European Union the better. These illegal immigrants will be quickly given European passports and next stop UK :(	1
Machine gun them or attract sharks and sink their boats 🚣 😂	0
The E U wanted them so they got them . Probably trained terrorists among them . Crazy politics.	0
Merkel wanted them. Not EU. But since she rules whole EU...	1
Julie Gordon exactly, Germany are the E U . What merkel wants the E U does.	1
Better yet, The Navy : at least they're armed with serious artillery!.	1
This is why God invented machine guns.	0
sure it wouldn't be christian if it wasn't a instrument of death.ehh!	1
They are neither refugees nor migrants. They are invaders.	0
Why ain't the Navy mining the harbour?	0
If they can get in unchecked how much drugs do?	1
Illegals who knows who they r and if they r criminals among them but they r called migrants	0
Does Italy not have a navy to send them back from where they came from?	0
illegal migrants send them straight back	0
Strategically placed 50 cal's on Europe's beaches would stop this happening...	0

The man , who lied ton the press & the world , about being in the boat with them , along with there were fleeing from a safe country there had been in , for the last 3 years . Does he honestly belive people have forgotton the true story , He is doing more harm than good , to people that genuiely need help , by fronting this christmas messaged	0
I respect your opion , But all im doing is stating the facts . people dont forget storys like is , as it was heartbreaking to see a dead child , But the truth was , he was not in the boat , Yes put a xmas message , out , that will help the genuie people fleeing from the war torn countrys But do it with some one , who as not lied to the world If that sounds cruel , im sorry	0
Robert Lee We still don't even know the truth, his stories were so varied. i.e. he's told lie after lie. He's completely untrustworthy. He was responsible but he can't take responsibility so continues to blame the west.	0
Qassem Soleimani Cruel? It seems the guy is a thieving lieing scum bag responsible for his own child's death.	0
HE WAS THE TRAFFICER - he and his family were living in turkey already for 3 years.	0
Robert Lee like most of these people,he put his family in danger putting them on a boat when he should have bought a ticket to fly his family to England.	1
There a reason , he did not put them on a plane , There would not have gained entry . As he was fleeing from a safe country , That why there try & gain enter illegal , Knowing legally there won't get in ,	1
He was the ONLY ONE using a lifejacket - even though his wife didn't knew how to swimm! Even though he had his children on the boat... I don't believe him not even a little bit!	1
Hold on.....this is the guy that left Turkey after being there for 4 yrs.....then put a life jacket on himself but couldn't have cared less about his wife and children and left them to the elements to DIE because he wanted to go to Greece and get his teeth done! I have a Christmas message for him......get lost and go home and fight for your country stop the sob stories we are done with the tricks you all seem to play.......	0
"Does he mean ""The Whole Western Christian World opened their doors"" did not see the Muslim countries open their doors. How strange?????"	1
You should be fighting for your country with all the other Syrian cowards who have dumped themselves on the European welfare system	0
Agree. And the aholes Republicans want to send our boys to die so these effing cowards can come here and live off our welfare system...Hell No!	0
Maybe we should open doors to all, but shouldnt the people that live in this country come first like our children, homeless, poor, disabled, elderly and vetrans. These are the people that money is being taken away from to let you refugees live in the lap of luxury. So unless you can bring your own wealth with you please be thoughtful of the people that already live in this country that are badly off and will become worse off	1
Says the man who was allegedly a thieving illegal people trafficker himself, who has to accept full responsibility for the decisions that led to his own child's death, who was running away from long term safe sanctuary in Turkey for his own greedy personal gain at our expense in Europe. Channel 4 really should be censured by the UK Broadcasting authorities for even contemplating this piece of blatant Islamic far left wing propaganda.	0
There are plenty of neighbouring wealthy countries to Syria. Why are they not taking in refugees?? I am all for helping people in need but the UK is struggling enough financially as it is without bringing hundreds of thousands more people in who will need homes (we are already short), school places (we are already short), hospital treatment (already understaffed and run into the ground) and benefits (massively overstretched already).	1
We've got to have 13 000 here in Australia, And they hate out guts! So if the statics are right and 99% of them are good people...only 130 want to kill us	0
I thought he'd gone to Canada ?. He was also believed to have taken the risk to try and repair his teeth free. Did he not have a job/lived in a flat in Turkey? He put his family at risk for personal reasons which killed them, why does he think I would be interested in his heart rendering Christmast message!.	1
"The Syrian refugees and any others in that region who hop on the bandwagon are supposedly looking for REFUGE, not trying to exploit a situation to improve their wealth and standard of living at the expense of others! Why travel 1000 miles to ""safety"" when refuge is only across a nearby border? It stinks!!"	1
It worked on the British people before...will work again. Of course it was sad to see that boy on the beach, i wanted to cry. BUT to then base your whole immigration policy on that was crazy. Thats what you Brits did and will do again whenever a earth shattering photo comes up.	0
Rubbish...Get the Drama out of reporting! You are being conned every single minute and finger typing second of the day......Tell the truth and stop selling your own twisted notion of conscience..there is no moral base to the assertions and without that its just another big Fib !	0
Well, sorry for his loss but I don't think the whole world should open its door to Syrians. It will cause countless problems because today's foolish kindness.	1
Well, some that are already in the western world is complaining that the weather is bad and that they are not being given houses and cars. Stay in Turkey and there abouts, and stop all that photo porn, we've seen it, end of.	0
Why don't the Syrians go to Russia, To wit: at 17,075,400 square kilometres (6,592,800 sq mi), Russia is the largest country in the world, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area.....this is a rhetorical question....the refugess want to go where the largest amount of free goodies are.	1
Tell rich arabian countries to open its doors. Christian countries must shut down the doors..	1
Id like all christian countries and the ones who value their identities and traditions to slam the door firmly shut in there faces..... Surely they should just get on there knees face mecca and start wailing away.....	1
I'd like to see people fighting back like the majority of the west did. There is a rite of passage to democracy and freedom. If your not prepared to stand for it you don't understand it.not saying don't look after people. But some of these issues should be dealt with in house.	1
Hey friend you want from wolves to be shepherd ,you are expecting expensive things from cheap people or it is better to call them evil robots.	1
He had lived in safety in Turkey for 3 years so why did he risk his family lives. Fellow passengers on the dingy claimed that he was a people smuggler and disposed of his documents on arrival and claimed he had come from Syria.	1
It would be a good idea for the neighbouring Muslim states to open their doors to Syrians, why have rich nations such as Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia etc not taken any in?	1
Because their agenda is to spread Islam all over the world.	1
He was living safely in Turkey for 4 years before he decided to get more money from the West, at the cost of his kids life. Scum	0
Opening the doors to Syrians is like letting a load off rats in ur house . Once their there they all have loads of kids and claim benefits. There's no War in France so why don't they stay there, or stay in their own country and fight for what they believe in ! Just want a free Ride even tho they hate the western countries supposedly, bullshitting Cunts	0
What's the fuss with Syrian boy died ? More children dieds in Africa, 100s of children died in Vietnam, Cambodia, Japan and the list goes on. One Syrian boy and whole world must open their gate ?	1
The kid wasn't even wet ffs. Propaganda photo.	0
Ok, why don't you bring them in your house?	1
Ok. At least you are not a hypocrite. People want to bring others in, yet they can't being them in their house. I don't think we should allow people in unvetted. The FBI says they can't properly vet them. Safety is number 1. There are numerous homeless people and they don't get the same attention.	1
If the politicians stopped funding wars, this would not be happening.	1
The trouble is Micky, is that half of those who are coming are not refugees. There are others from middle eastern countries who are abusing the refugee crisis, to get here also!! ...Also, there is a threat that ISIS have planted their own fighters among refugees to harm us and quite frankly, it is rather stupid of countries to let them in, so long as ISIS remains a world presence.	1
ISIS is a legitimate threat. They have attacked France 6 times. This is a serious matter. Don't be naïve about this and call people racist for being against open boarders. We need to be safe.	0
I am speaking in general. National security is important. Liberals who are actually authoritarian want chaos. They defend an evil religion of Islam. I can't stand people who boast about being morally high. No one is better than someone else. We all have sinned. So we are all on the same playing field. Righteousness only comes form Yeshua (Jesus). No one is self righteous.	0
Look i read so half and then you got me... Your obsessed with the difficulty of what's happening and as seeing then judge and point so to speak. Why is your heart like that? Why are you so so ugly? Please circle yourself round them and then judge.	0
This country is full we just can't take any more refugees our NHS is at breaking point and there isn't enough housing	1
Is this guy on something......?	1
Micky Galway Furey... cool story mate. Stay off the weed!	1
Micky Galway Furey. The man lied simple as	0
The man who lied to everyone, wore a life jacket and let his wife and kids go without, lived and worked in turkey for 4 years before deciding he could get some lovely new teeth free of charge from good old Europe! He needs to disappear and stop playing the victim, he killed his family	0
Don't use Christmas as a Propoganda tool either!! Anyone putting their childrens lives at risk to enter a country, when they were for four years safe in another country is scum in my eyes!!!!......There is a very real threat that ISIS fighters are among these people, which could well result in MORE innocent children dying. Yet nobody seems to be thinking across those lines, particularly not our governments!! What happened to that young child is terrible, a tragedy.....but do we want more dead children in the UK at the hands of terrorists ?? ......NO!!!!!!......We could avoid more innocent deaths on either side, if Saudi Arabia opened its doors to these people.	1
Ya, you're a moron. Amantakesitdeep	0
They need to go home man the hell up and fight for their own country instead of forcing themselves on ppl who clearly don't want them.	0
So how many Syrians have you personally and your family taken in Amandeep? Or are you all talk?	1
Your referring to the real refugees, the ones Saudi, Turkey and USA made, still in the camps, not the ones paying people smugglers to take them to Europe, carrying false passports. Big difference!	1
Philip Murphy. You'll find it's the governments that are responsible and not a whole country of people!!!!!	1
There is plenty of space in Muslim countries, they don't need to go to places which are totally opposite to their beliefs. We have neither the space nor the means to take them	1
Karen Elizabeth Evangelista its been proven that Saudi, Turkey and USA were financing mercs to fight against the legal government in Syria(Assad). Saudi wants the entire region islamic, USA wants the oil and gas. Saudi spent 4yrs destabilizing that region, and now, we are seeing the results of their work, while they build a 1000k wall around Saudi to keep everyone else out..so much for the leaders of the UNHCR-no rights unless you are shia-and the new leaders of the global terrorism gang	0
Philip Murphy. So you've asked every single person in the USA, Saudi, and Turkey Yeah? And checked the bank balances? You're saying you did this but I kind of don't believe you.	1
All I ever see on the Daily Fail are humans but no humanity. All I said was RIP to the 3500 dead refugees including children floating in the Mediterranean and that showing compassion to those less fortunate because their lives have been destroyed and their houses bombed would make you a decent human being. I'm sick of all the constant hatred and divide. Human beings are dying over needless wars. I knew I'd get trolled for writing a human comment. Some things never change on this page.	0
shut up blud .😂 amandeep .. ffsk man wtf is ur problem ?? go to syrian and build a house for them if u care so much !! why r u hyping for no reason	0
Amandeep Lallie. As you are so sick of gatecrashing into comments on the British newspaper, you obviously know the answer and that is to piss off.	0
Karen - I never understand a word you say. You comment on absolutely everything but never make any sense whatsoever. You're the biggest troll around here even if it is unintentional. You're just a vile woman. I've also repeatedly told you I'm not from India, I'm British yet you still harp on about me involving myself in British affairs. I can comment on a British newspaper as I'm British you dumb woman.	0
Yes I understand what you are saying as you Karen are racist. Every post I write on you call me 'Indian' and use it as an insult. You can't even tell the difference between nationality and ethnicity. I was born in England. My parents were born in England. I've never been to India yet your racist mind can't get past the colour of my skin. I'm British whether you like it or not you racist bat. You judge people based on skin colour and ethnicity even though it's completely irrelevant to what they're saying, which is to be a decent human being. My points are clearly lost on you as you're not a decent human being.	0
AND for the FINAL TIME - how many Syrian people have you personally taken in, or your family taken in? Because the fact is, you're just all talk on you, a worthless piece of cow dung that has nothing to do in life except be a tragic waste of air and waste to space trying to cause trouble any way he can. F*cking useless.	0
Well you find it funny Elcan but you do realise that in the racist mind of Karen - you're 'Indian' so according to her logic 'not British' and not welcome right? Word of advice - don't associate yourself with racists and small-minded bigots unless you are one yourself.	0
Karen is a vile human being who only likes white people. Imagine her surprise when she will actually see a Syrian child for the first time only to be perplexed at how fair and 'white' their complexion is... Would blow the racist buffoon's mind. Karen - why don't you google 'Assad's children' and see how white they look. Doubt your small mind would be able to handle the shock.	0
Oh wow I just noticed that Karen has deleted her vile rant where she said I'm stupid and uneducated and I'm Indian and not British and blah blah blah, which warranted my reply to educate the racist troll and teach her the difference between nationality and ethnicity. No backbone whatsoever. She spews racism and bigotry and hatred and then deletes it. At least leave your vile views up for all to see as you clearly stand by them.	0
Yes they will because they're are fleeing 1000 of miles to 'safety' when there is refuge for them not far away	1
We would... But you want to come to UK or Germany for their welfare system, be happy you can go to Romania or a similar country, it is not in war. Even Lebanon. Genuine refugees are a minority in all of this.	1
Romania similar country . Since when dear? You know nothing;) We may not have the same economy but please, keep your arguments for yourself.	0
You know nothing if you can't read darling. I said countries similar to Romania like Albania.	0
with all due respect, Mr Kurdi I would like my country back. I would like every single person in Britain to have a roof over their heads, a full belly, a warm bed to sleep in, a job for those who can work. For too long now Britain has given trillions away to other countries but who helps us? No one. There was recently a flood in Cumbria, people lost their homes. Who offered to help? No one. I'm so sorry for your loss, Mr Kurdi but charity begins at home. Britain must help their own first. Britain is not the worlds bank manager!	1
This man, a proven human trafficker who had a good life and home in Turkey. Denied access to Canada on that basis. A man full of lies who cries false tears for his wife and family. Like so many of men have survived as your families have perished due to greed. If you care for Syria that much go back and fight to take it back.	0
The kid was living in Turkey and was with his father posing as a refugee so he could get free dental care in Europe.	1
Julie Julie then they'd just be demonstrating their stupidity.	0
All this story in this report is very heart rendering until I read the last part - trying to get to Germany or Sweden - what about all the other Arabic and Islamic countries and all the countries in between? This sacrifice is not about safety any more it's about going to a country to find a better life FOR FREE and AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS who already live in that country as has their generations of family and continually paid in to it, without trying to fight for their own. Of course losing children and any other part of the family is an horrendous thing, but that's where my pity ends and I have no sympathy apart from that.	1
My message to him would be off the first word begining with f	0
Oh go away you have had your 15,mins of fame all the lies that were uncovered about you and your family!!!!!	0
The world will open its doors to the suffering but the suffering are taking advantage of our kindness.	1
What about the 130 Dead in France killed by Syrian refugees and Terrorists coming in this refugee influx? The Christmas of These families are forever ruined!!! Daily Fail and all leftist News media STOP THIS PROPOGANDA NOW!!!	0
I'd like military-aged Syrian men to pick up a rifle and fight for their country.	1
It won't happen as oil and water do not -Will not mix, so don't try to force it upon us in Westernized Northern Europe, and Especially us in the United Kingdom!!!	1
You basically killed him yourself trying for a new set of teeth and welfare no sympathy at all for grubs like you.	0
"Does he not realize that ISIS terrorists are among the ""Syrians""? Does the media not know this? Propaganda! Let the media,and those celebs open THEIR doors to the ""Syrians""!"	0
My message to Syrians, take care of ur kids unlike this schmucko	0
